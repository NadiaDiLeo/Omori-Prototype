    "selftext": "Ghost Mari appears throughout the game to encourage Sunny to confront his issues, and whether or not people believe she is real or not, she kinda carries some rather unfortunate implications in the story to some people.\n\nFor one, she appears to have no ill will or grudge for what Sunny and Basil did to her. In fact, she is the one that seem apologetic to Sunny, for supposedly 'pushing him too hard' (we don't get a good idea on how rough the practice was on Sunny, only that he didn't like it). This paints a very weird picture of the incident, bordering on how an abuse victim blames themselves for their abuser's actions.\n\nThis also paints a negative picture of Sunny as well, tainting his journey of self forgiveness and trauma recovery. If this is all in Sunny's head, Not only is it weird for him to constantly stuff words in Mari's mouth to comfort him and forgive him, it's kinda gross how she is almost used as a tool on his journey to forgive himself. Worse yet it would seem like he is shifting blame from the incident by implying he wouldn't have hurt Mari if she wasn't so mean to him. It feels like we never see the real Mari and how she really feels about everything.\n\nIt sometimes feels like Mari isn't respected as a person by the fandom as well all the other characters are, only used as a tool for Sunny to comfort himself, and never a person who would be rightfully angry at her brother for what he did to her.\n\nBut what do you think of her inclusion in the plot, does it enhance or hurt the story?",

This is a reasonable take on her character, as ghost Mari would have seen everything that happened to her brother and the friend group, and likely find herself to be the root cause of it. Whether that's right from our perspective or not is a different can of worms.\n\nIn the case of 2, remember that Sunny pictures Mari to be perfect. Mari is perfect, she is never at fault, never wrong, and she can do no wrong. She is so good that she would even apologize for something that Sunny wholly blames himself for. Sunny pictures Mari to be perfect, remembers her that way, and so she acts that way.\n\nI do not think it hurts the story at all.",

Sunny was the main one at fault, but that doesn't mean she didn't contribute in some way to what happened (Admittedly to a significantly lesser degree). Rather than it being disrespectful I see it as either, Mari owning up to her own mistakes while wishing the best for her brother who she loved, or Sunny putting Mari on a pedestal and looking at her as someone so perfect that she'd apologize for even the smallest mistake. Mari was always depicted as emotionally mature for her age, so I think if she were able to give her opinion then it would be one of understanding and acceptance, rather than anger and blame. If she's just a figment of Sunny's imagination then it would arguably be more disrespectful to paint her in that light when there's no precedent for it.\n\nI'd argue that Sunny \"putting words in her mouth\" isn't so much an act of comfort for himself as much as it's an acknowledgement of everything he's ruined with his actions. If it were just a form of comfort then why is he still eating himself alive after the numerous iterations of white space? Even if it were just a form of comfort then clearly it doesn't actually hold water in Sunny's mind and he likely views it as just wishful thinking, which I would say is entirely reasonable considering the circumstances. Why wouldn't he wish for forgiveness? The whole story centers around the idea of forgiveness and whether or not Sunny can be redeemed for his mistakes. Ultimately whether he can or can't is up to the viewer's interpretation, but one way or another Sunny realizes he'll never answer that for himself unless he comes clean.",

        "body": "Ok, so let's get this out of the way first. Ghost are real in Omori. This is seen through Mari, but also Basil's grandmother. They are heavily implied to be real. So him thinking it all up isn't the case, ghost Mari is a form of real Mari. We can debate she's not, but if we debate that we are just changing the story. So while it could be fun to debate it as a \"what if\" it's not really relevant when talking about the games themes. \n\nI think your attitude of -\n\n>bordering on how an abuse victim blames themselves for their abuser's actions.\n\n\\-even implying *this* is relevant in this circumstance is very strange. We are talking about a 12 year old boy who got into an argument with his sister after an age appropriate outburst to stress pushing her away from him when she tried to block his way into his room. That is objectively the entire decision he made. \n\nEven implying it's comparable to abuse is like, well imagine if someone walked into a cupboard door someone else is opening and it gives them a bloody nose, the person who opened the door apologizes for hurting the other person (even though it was unintentional, because that's what you do if you hurt someone accidentally), the person with the bloody noose then apologizes for not looking where they were going. You are the bystander yelling at the blooded nose person for \"apologizing for being abused.\" No, not the scenario. There is no abuse here. Yes there is a victim, but they are a victim of an accident.\n\nIf the two were on the other level of the house, all him pushing her would have done is pushed her out of the way. At worst, she would have landed on her bum. The fact there were on top of stairs is very clearly just something not factored into his actions (because what 12 year old would think about that when they're upset and trying to get to their room). Objectively this is not an abuse scenario. This was a horrible accident. The then hanging her after was already after she was dead. She's not there anymore, she's not a victim of that. The victims of that are Sunny's parents and his/Mari's friends. Which is horrible, but it's not abuse and it's honestly another conversation entirely.\n\n>Worse yet it would seem like he is shifting blame from the incident by implying he wouldn't have hurt Mari if she wasn't so mean to him\n\nExcept that's just true. No where in the game does it say \"mean\", but \"strict\" is correct. Mari is shown throughout the game to be a perfectionist who gets angry when things aren't perfect. We know she put huge pressure on a 12 year old to be as perfect as she is. That's what caused Sunny to break the violin, which caused the argument. Even then, what actually caused her death was no the violin breaking or the argument, it was blocking Sunny's exit from an overwhelming upsetting scenario after the argument was done. I don't think it's fair to say she's the cause of her death, after all it was an accident on all ends and she was only 15. Standing in the way is a pretty normal sibling response. It was never meant to end like that. As they hammer into you in the game, if she hadn't had an injured leg, she'd still be alive as the push was not that strong. It was all an accident.\n\nWith all that context. Why would she be upset? If she wanted Sunny punished, well he was, he spent years punishing himself for it. He ruined his life after doing it. What does she have to hate him for? It was an accident at the end of the day. She deeply loved Sunny and he loved her. 4 years on from her death she wants him to stop blaming himself because it was an accident that was caused by many factors including her own actions. Saying it's \"gross\" for her to want her brother to do well makes me think you view her the same way as the rest of the fandom, a pretty victim who can do nothing wrong and should only ever be treated as perfect.",

UNTIL SPACEBOY BECOMES ENRAGED AND PRETTY MUCH ONE-SHOTS BASIL, THEN PROCEEDS TO MAKE OMORI USE PLOT ARMOR, AND FINALLY DOES 467 DAMAGE TO OMORI WHICH IS EQUAL TO HIS MAX HEALTH.\n\nKeep in mind Omori and Basil's skills and charms are:\nOmori- Sad Poem, Cripple for speed down, Red Hands, and Guard. Omori has Flower Crown equipped\nBasil- I left his the same for when he joins the party for Boss Rush.\nBasil has cough mask equipped.\n\nAre there any suggestions and tips for any future runs of the challenge you guys can give me? Tips regarding skills, equipment, and healing items I need to stock up on would be very, VERY nice.\n",

    "selftext": "Just finished the game and I don't have a place to talk about and dump all this emotional rollercoaster so I decided to make a review post.\n\n\nI remembered seeing this game years ago and said oh its one of those horror rpgs, wasn't a hardcore fan of the genre so I just left it in my bucket list. When I finally got the time to experience it, I'm glad I didn't spoil myself before in what is this game really about and damn those warning stuff at the beginning of the game was so damn right.\n\n\n>! It was cute at first and I wanted to make decisions as how I naturally myself would make one to get an authentic feel of the game. The moment Basil went go full breakdown in the headscape shoe house, it already grabbed my attention cause I didn't expect shit would go down that fast. Also the way I get jumpscared whenever its nighttime in the house specially the part where Mari was knocking at the door. !<\n\n\n>! Also funny thing too, when I was still in the forest, I thought there was some Undertale thing in the game where we shouldn't kill and just keep choosing run option. I realized I'm prolly doing something wrong when I'm getting my ass handed by the enemies cause I'm barely leveled up. !<\n\n\n>! When I finally met Kel and had a day in the real world, for some reason I prefered it there than going in headscape cause I kind of started realizing everything feels like a lie over there. I didn't hate it there, actually love the aesthetic and cuteness of the world but knowing the world was a form of coping made me feel bad for Sunny. And I still had the question \"If everything seemed so perfect and happy, where did it go wrong?\" !<\n\n\n>! The room with the arm throne scared the shit out of me psychologically paired with how depressing every time I see Basil become pieces, specially the boat and elevator part.... Collecting the b&w pictures for the album was really saddening finding out what really happened and the part I realized it was Basil's pov and he was the one who decided to make Mari's death look like a suicide in my understanding. !<\n\n\n>! My roll of toilet paper almost all got used up during memory lane, specially the part seeing their home and family picture aren't distorted. Also had to retry multiple times during Omori face off cause bruh is hitting so hard with his attacks and I had skill issue. !<\n\n\n>! The ending scene where he wokes up and cry was so beautiful and every part of that scene got me bawling my eyes. Even while reading the plants that were delivered made it a trip to sob town for me. Surprisingly I got the secret ending which makes me happy for a first try. The open ending left me the impression that its the same with what's the moral of the story trying to say. !<\n\n\nI'd love to replay this game but I'd probably need a few weeks or months to digest and process everything that happened in my gameplay. I never got the chance to explore the pyramid part island of headspace too and there's still many side quests I'm interested in completing. Overall this game was a lovely experience and a masterpiece also love love LOVE the soundtrack~\n\n\n\n",

The ending did make me cry but i thought its going to be way more sad. The ending for me went like this: I went to basil s house at the end of  the last day and tried to comfort him. Later night i woke up and got into his room where i had to fight him. After i won the fight the truth got revealed and etc. In the fight against omori i died once but i pressed continue then woke up in the hospital where i followed basil s shadow. Then went to basil s room and it wrote. I have to tell you something. Some questions i still have like: How did the violin get broken? was it intentional? Who or what is the SOMETHING is it omori? Did sunny in this ending tell everyone what happened? Ty all for the support for my earlier posts and the replies to this one too!!",

    "selftext": "when i was a kid i was bullied and tormented by my mom and used as a scapegoat for everything because i was the queer autistic kid, even if i often didn't do anything, and it would always be really scary and traumatic blahblah. i've somewhat repressed most of these memories later in life until i got into omori, and seeing aubrey's frankly awful treatment of basil throughout the game made a lot of those memories resurface because of how close to home it hit watching him be helplessly victimized. this is made even worse by the fact that he didn't even ruin the photo album which started the bullying in the first place, so he went through all of that additional trauma over nothing, and again as a kid i was blamed for a lot of stuff i didn't do too so this part of the story was very uncalled for and just dug up a lot of childhood memories i don't want to remember.\n\nthe complete lack of closure on this subplot also hurts a lot because the game just made me watch and relive all of that stuff with no justice or resolution delivered, and i've felt like this over bagel for like 3-4 months now to the point where i even tried making a fangame/mod that tries to tie it up and give brazil a cathartic ending, but as stupid as this might sound the more i let my mind sit on this stuff the more it takes a toll on my own mental health so i eventually had to tap out from it.\n\nthis is such a small part of omori's plot but it's become basically the only part of the game i think/care about (which is tragic because again this subplot is undercooked and unsatisfying asf compared to everything else), like idegaf about the mari situation anymore i just hate how bagel was a punching bag for 4 years :(\n\nis it normal for me to empathize with the plight of basil this much even though he doesn't actually exist and i can't actually do anything to help him? why did you do this to me omocat?",

    "selftext": " ‚úø peace be upon you ~ pretty sure kel is taller than 5‚Äô7. And remember short friends, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not little I just live in a big world‚Äù. And big world it is! Kel is like one of my irl friends‚Äî-he was shorter than me before summer break and now imm not even at his shoulders anymore. Tragic. *tragic!*\n\n‚úø üçä So hey‚Ä¶spoilers but, when Kel first knocked on the door in OMORI me and my little  cousins felt our heart do a thump. Yk it‚Äôs a blind play through for us, we‚Äôre in 3 days left at Sweetheart‚Äôs place And‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so bittersweet knowing that Sunny was probably still imagining Kel as his headspace/ younger self  ( since he hadn‚Äôt seen him in 4 years ). I‚Ä¶I just wonder if Kel had ever tried knocking before then, yk? Or anyone else for that matter. I can imagine a saddened Aubrey just knocking on the door pitifully before leaving, same with Basil‚Ä¶\n\n‚úø ‚Ä¶and I think it‚Äôs touching that Sunny loves his friends so much. Idk how the story ends, or where it‚Äôs going, but I‚Äôm just saying from personal experience, when you really, REALLY someone, in this case Sunny and his friends, you always find a way to rekindle that friendship. Where there‚Äôs love‚Ä¶there‚Äôs hope afterall. So don‚Äôt give up on your friends and family either k? Godbless ~ ( and congratulations your reading level went up + 2 for going to the end ).",

We were happy the whooooole day cuz he showed Sunny around then he just kept choosing the wrong dialogue options in the church fight . :/ That church fight was truly a work of art, seeing the happy bubbly HEADSPACE Aubrey reduced to a traumatized mess because life failed her‚Ä¶\n\n‚äπ ÔπèìäùÔπèìÇÅÔπè‚äπ Àñ Islam‚Äôs P.S. | God I wanna just sit and play with my family cuz I wanna see what happens next ( I‚Äôm at sweethearts castle‚Äôs entrance woo! ) but alas, I have school and tests and projects and work and everything else‚Ä¶sigh alhamduillah.

    "selftext": "So I wanted to talk about the direction the manga is laying out the story. \n\nFirst and foremost as a disclaimer / credential:\n\nI *am* a maladaptive daydreamer who ALSO has a headspace mechanism.\n\nOmori means A LOT to me because I had never seen a piece of media portray this coping mechanism that I had also been using since I was 13.\n\nAnd for a while I thought I was freaking crazy- [my therapist says I am not and this coping mechanism is actually a really healthy way to deal with trauma as long as one doesnt blur the lines of reality and imagination]. \n\nAnd while I loved the video games portrayal- it wasnt exactly perfect.\n\nBut! The way they are doing it in the manga is taking my breath away- its like im experiencing it for the first time all over again- headspace events going on during lapses in Sunny's attention / in times of stressors causing him to dissassociate frequently - is so accurate to how this works [at least for me] in real life! And it makes me feel a little valid and seen. Because \"sleeping\" to go into headspace just kinda makes it feel like those 2020 tiktok shifters [iykyk] and its not exactly how it works [at least for me!] \n\nHowever besides myself- and now experiencing Omori- Ive never heard or seen anyone else who actually does this!\n\n[My therapist said its apparently something therapists are beint taught and trying to teach people with CPTSD and PTSD to do to help them but its amazing that ive been doing it on my own for years!] \n\nI'd love to discuss this further or answer any questions one may have about maladaptive daydreaming / head space coping mechanism!\n\n(I apologize for any spelling / grammar- I am dyslexic and I tried double checking everything before sending!)

Easily one of my favorite games of all time. My favorite boss fight was the final fight against Omori although Sweethearts fight was fun too from the sheer catharsis of finally being able to fight her.  The Humphry fight was the scariest one imo, very unsettling.\n\n(Also that spelling bee npc could go suck my ****) \n\nNow that I've beaten the game and had a chance to reflect, I wanted to ask the community:\n\nDo you think you'd be able to forgive Sunny if you were one of his friends? \n\nSince we spent the game in his shoes, you understand and empathize how much guilt he has over Mari's death. And I'd so badly love for his crew and family to forgive his mistake.\n\nBut I'll be honest.... It would be very difficult for me to forgive. After four years of thinking it was suicide, only to find out Sunny and Basil knew all along that it wasn't. I know they're kids but man... \n\nIt would be challenging to forgive.

One of my patients & I recently discovered our mutual love for OMORI, so I decided to make him an OMORI themed card! His favorite character is Basil :) \n\nAlthough I am leaving my job way before he finishes, I wanted to make this for him so that he knows I‚Äôm still rooting for him! \n\nI am an amateur artist at best, so I screenshotted a ‚ÄúBasil tagged you‚Äù picture, printed it out, scribbled the back with pencil & traced over it on the other side on to the card. \n\nIf youre also a KOTH fan, i made a similar post back in October/November with a KOTH themed card for a different patient!

    "selftext": "Idk a name i could put in this AU lmao\n\n# Sunny & the voices:\n\nSunny - Sunny has become a shut-in person just like the main universe due to >!mari's death!< , however, his traumas, instead of taking shape in his dreams, he basically supressed all of that, pretending that mari never existed, but it has created 2 voices that talks about what he done (but not reminding of what exact) as consequence. Even if he barely gets out of home, he sometime go see his friends (major of times due to his mom), but besides that, his personality is a bit more open to talk but his is also slightly grumpy.\n\nThe patience - one of the voices, who has something's shape but blueish, is basically the manifestation of sunny's idea if mari forgive him after all what happened. It basically has mari's personality and behavior, but more caring and calm, always remembering that it wasn't sunny's fault, but never trying to convince him to move on.\n\nThe wrath - being the complete opposite of the patience, not only the wrath is a something but red-ish, it's basically sunny's idea if mari started to hate and dislike him, never forgiving his error, always arguing with the patience and making sunny upset. It's interaction with sunny is basically mari behavior, but instead of love, care and forgiveness, it HATES sunny for everything he did.\n\nThe truth - but what if sunny somehow remember or get reminded of mari's existence? Well, both voices will become one, a white something with mari's personality and behavior, the truth, but the difference is... IT. WILL. CHASE. SUNNY. And that will keep up until sunny forget about mari's existence again,  but meanwhile, sunny can't even look at it, otherwise sunny will have an increasingly anxiety and panic that resembles static noise in his head, but what if it caught sunny? Well... oyasumi :) \n\n# faraway gang\n\nAubrey - her personality is (majorly) the same as she also joined the hooligans, but... instead of simply thinking that all her old friends abandoned her, she thought... \"sunny is the only one who usually talks with me even after everything that happened. But is he okay? Oh sunny, i will protect you if you need then!\" And due her own home problems and loneliness due to her old friends disband, she secretly developed a overprotectiveness and small dependency towards sunny, even though she doesn't seemly express that (but she does stalk him a bit).\n\nKel - kel also didn't changed a lot, although he got more sassy and bolder, and by some reason he really wants to sunny be his little brother, enough to make him knock on sunny's house door daily. He still has hector.\n\nHero - hero keeps being hero, though, he's WAY more concerned and caring about sunny and his mental state after what mari did to herself, enough to make him start studying about therapy just so he can help sunny and other people in that way. He didn't fully moved on after mari's death, but he knows that's what mari would've wanted.\n\nBasil - he's less psychologically screwed up and always tries to talk with sunny when he can, although, by some reason sunny can't remember who exactly who he is, and even worser, sunny is scared of him (sunny sees The truth behind him, even tho it doesnt charge against him since he didn't finded out about mari yet) . Basil didn't chaged a lot, but he still has some strong need of protecting sunny, a will driven by trauma and dependence\n\n# dreamspace boys\n\nOmori - instead of a being the >!manifestation of sunny's depression and stuff!< he's actually just another voice in sunny's mind, in this case, his dream. He's basically omori but like a homie with sunny.\n\nStranger - basically instead of a very scaring and ominous guy, he's basically a goofy ass mf that lives with omori in dreamspace. He likes old clocks a lot, but how much? Well...\nThis is how he feels if someone breaks his clocks:\n https://youtu.be/jMn-d3cSf_o?si=iYnHFjBCnOue-cgM\n\n(He definitely doesn't like clocks because it's a way of saying it's sunny hidden will of oyasumi'ing himself. But why a clock? Well... My time)",

Not once did I ever even suspect that Mari had not died of a suicide, and even less that it was Sunny who killed her. The final duet was enough to make me tear up, which was surprising since I rarely get that emotional when it comes to video games. I had a lot of fun with this game, all of it. The music, the combat, the characters, dialogue, everything. Again, that twist was just ‚Ä¶ phenomenal. In a sad way, of course. I can‚Äôt imagine uow Sunny must have felt since that incident occured. All the guilt, the trauma, the pain. \n\nLast thing, I searched it up, and turns out I managed to get the good / true ending !!

I think it was the lack of drama and the brutal realism in the way Kel talked about it that made me cry; it was sort of like actually talking to someone in person about a serious topic.

These are the base designs of the characters, aged up characters, by the way, all of them start with a progressed age by the beggining of the story. What's the deal with all of them? Why there is a Mari there when she should be...you know? (Yes, this is not a Mari Lives or Mari Revives AU, believe it or not).\n\nWell, that will be revived with time. For now, i will leave it there. I hope you like the designs and i hope to hear some feedback. If you want to read about their backstories, i would be happy to share it with you in DM's, since they deal with very heavy topics and they are also still in development. \n\nFor conclussion, i will cite my main inspirations for the AU:\n\nThe work of Sam Lake and the games of Remedy, especially Max Payne 1 & 2 and Alan Wake 2 and Control (Also Max Payne 3 is a major inspiration, but that was developed by Rockstar Vancouver with little involvement of Sam Lake and Remedy).\n\nThe run of the writer Brian Michael Bendis with the character Daredevil.\n\nThe movies of united states director David Fincher.\n\nThe videogames of Hideo Kojima, especially Metal Gear Solid 2, MGSV, and Death Stranding.\n\nThe work of non-binary comic book writer Grant Morrison, especially their work in the comic Animal Man, Batman, Flex Mentallo, Doom Patrol, and All Star Superman.\n\nThe raw sincerity of the music of late writer and musician Lou Reed.\n\nThe 90's album trilogy of Scottish Band U2 (Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Pop)\n\nA lot of badly written or abhorrent works that i have encountered in my way on the Internet that have fueled with an urge to make things better and actually do good things. \n\nAnd in a more sad note, a lot of tragic, gruesome, and abhorrent real life cases and daily situations, especially of my country, Mexico, and the current sociopolitical state of the world.\n\n-May you have a pleasant day.\n\n‚ÄìIrina Delilah.

    "selftext": "This sounds random, but if you think about it, the parallels are pretty uncanny.\n\nBoth medias are about a timid guy that experience some sort of childhood trauma, and because of it, begin to isolate themselves. Sunny creates himself the headspace, while Pink, the main character of The Wall, tries to distance himself by building a metaphorical wall around him. These coping mechanisms/escapisms play as a surreal version of the real world, where everything is just right, and the main characters get to be the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù versions of themselves. Both stories end with the main character facing reality, as Sunny internally battles his headspace counterpart Omori, while Pink is sentenced to tear down the wall in the trial. The result of these actions leave both characters vulnerable and broken, but it gives them a spark of hope, allowing them an opportunity to grow from their mistakes. I‚Äôm not sure if The Wall really was an inspiration to Omori, but after taking this in, it definitely feels like it. What do y‚Äôall think? \n\n",

    "selftext": "The person who asked about to sprite got me going! I‚Äôve posted this on my tumblr too so I hope it can be of use to someone or at least an interesting read. Please let me know your thoughts!\n\n\n___________\nMAJOR SPOILERS \n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: These are my interpretations and opinions. I am but a random person behind a computer so if you disagree with anything that's completely fine! There is no right or wrong way to write or express a character, especially (Emphasis on this) in fanfiction! :)\n\nLet‚Äôs get into it! (Very Long Post warning)\n\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢Personality and Character Analysis‚Ä¢**\n\n\nFirst, we will look at what OMOCAT has to say about her character, then we will take a look at Fanon Basil, and finally some random likes and dislikes that people may forget.\n\n\nBasil‚Äôs personality as stated by OMOCAT is supposed to come off as sweet and gentle, which is something we noticed right off the bat in the game. You enter the park and instantly meet up with Mari and are introduced to a flower-crown wearing boy who is bashful and humble, often talking down his skills in photography but still has a wholesome cheer to his hope.¬†\n\n\nIn this statement from OMOCAT as seen in the end pages of the artbook where she discusses the game and characters alongside the other artists in the ‚Äòartists interview‚Äô, we can see from her eyes what kind of person she intended for Basil to be. His whole thing is looking sweet and gentle but having a very angsty side to him that he doesn‚Äôt like or want to admit despite very clearly being there. It‚Äôs like he is a coin and on either side is Flower or Rowan but with the lack of having it all together and an attempt to appear calm despite being a very nervous individual. She goes on to say that in response to The Truth Basil was completely unable to blame Sunny and had a dissonance of not being able to see him as a bad person. She also mentions when making a statement on how the friends are supposed to be set up, Basil‚Äôs description is ‚ÄúBasil‚Ä¶ Basil is someone who you can always count on and will do literally anything for you.‚Äù\n\n\n\n‚ÄúThe first iteration of him was calm and gentle- the type of character that has everything under control- a little more of a perfectionist, but all of those traits ended up on Mari instead. The next Basil iteration was Rowan, who didn‚Äôt have that calmness. He was just pure angst, supercharged with anger, and easy to cry. That type of character. That didn‚Äôt work well for me either, because I thought he was super annoying. So I made Basil by mixing parts of both Flower and Rowan. He seems angelic and caring from his appearance, mannerisms, and the way he‚Äôs thoughtful. But there‚Äôs still that angst underneath, which comes out through his nervousness. Even though he doesn‚Äôt admit it, it‚Äôs still there‚Ä¶‚Äù (OMOCAT, artbook.)\n\n\nFrom this artist's interview, we can infer that Basil is a very caring individual who will do anything for his friends and has a very difficult time with understanding that people really can do bad things. An interesting thing to note is that he does seem to have this view at his core that doing a bad thing can make someone a bad person. This may explain why he is so uncomfortable with the thought of having what he may see as ‚Äúundesirable traits.‚Äù He himself does not want to be a bad person. He truly wants to be a good person and aims to do what a good person would do but he often ends up going too far with it that it ends up hurting himself or others.\n\n\nThis shows when he doesn‚Äôt want to believe Sunny is a bad person for what he did. Sunny made a terrible, diabolical mistake, sure, but at least for you and I with a bird‚Äôs eye view and the power of literally seeing inside of his mind, we know he isn‚Äôt a bad person and is haunted by his mistake.¬†\n\n\nThis leads to the thought that Basil, who has these flaws and this internal insecurity, probably has an even deeper insecurity that he is as a whole a bad person. He knows what he did, he knows he has ‚Äúundesirable traits‚Äù, and he doesn‚Äôt want to admit that to himself. This is a constant internal conflict for him and may be seen from an overly nice persona to mask it.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs not even that he tries to hide this monstrous identity and that he‚Äôs some great big evil, it‚Äôs more that he just is unable to accept the fact that having some bad traits, trauma, or flaws isn‚Äôt actually enough to make him a bad person. The fact that he tries to hide that is at least thoughtful for the people around him, but like he does with helping others, he takes it way too far, and this leads him to being an incredibly avoidant character who has a hard time talking to people about things that are really bothering him.\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢Examples of Basil being avoidant and the lack of knowledge from his closest friends.‚Ä¢**\n\n\nKel, without knowing, gives him a way out of many situations. One such example is that ‚ÄúHe has a weak stomach‚Äù and believing he went to the bathroom on Three Days Left because he was sick. Basil takes this and runs with it without mentioning that it was actually a panic attack. Then, Kel goes on to say that ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs always had a weak stomach‚Äù implying that this is not the first time this has happened.¬†\n\nüö© RED FLAG: AVOIDANT\n\n\nIt also shows it has happened since their younger years which only pushes the idea that Basil, who is already an anxious character, has likely had this issue for a very long time, and has not told Kel about it at all. Not even when they were closer.¬†\n\n\n*‚ÄúHuh? Y-Yesterday?‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúW-What do you mean?‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúA-Ah... Oh, right...‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúYes, I feel much better now.\"* -Basil when being asked how he is feeling after his 'stomach ache'\n\nKel wanted to hangout? Basil says no? \n\nüö© RED FLAG: AVOIDANT \n\n\nPolly tries to talk to him but he is cold and locks himself in his room?\n\nüö© RED FLAG: you get the point.\n\n\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢The Friends and Their Reactions‚Ä¢**\n\n\nAubrey seems to know more about his state than Kel and is a little more intuitive about these situations, likely from their friendship before meeting the rest of the gang and perhaps from her own experiences at home. She could sense a huge difference in him after The Incident (Which would obviously cause him to be even more nervous). It is also mentioned that he ‚ÄúWent to the bathroom and she found the album on his bookshelf.‚Äù Which once again goes to show the bathroom is a safe space for him. She to some extent knows he has these tendencies but does not know how deep they run judging by her bullying. I will post a separate thread on her discussing her bullying and why it was so heated other than the obvious reasons soon. Basil has a similar issue with Aubrey as he does with Sunny by still looking at her from the lens of their childhood and refusing to accept that she was a bad person. This can be seen from the Japanese version of Omori where he referred to her as ‚ÄúAubrey Chan‚Äù (I believe, do correct me if I am wrong) during an argument at the park. He also tries his best to approach her despite her clearly being angry showing a clear detachment from the reality that is their current situation.\n\n\nSunny is an entirely different ballpark. While it can be argued that the incident led Basil to hermit himself and become more isolated, it can not be ignored that he has a habit of bottling his feelings and hiding his issues from his friends. Sunny was the friend he talked to the most towards the end and they grew to be best friends and shared a lot of common interests. Basil states in game that he likes taking care of things and that he sees Sunny as ‚Äúthe baby of the group‚Äù and that he needs to be taken care of. This could be due to Sunny‚Äôs own anxieties, reserved nature, and calmness. With someone who is quiet and calm and doesn‚Äôt really push people to reflect on themselves such as Aubrey, Sunny was likely the friend he could tell anything to without being judged.¬†\n\n\n*‚ÄúYeah! We talk about how cool and composed OMORI is all the time... Or about how AUBREY is so caring about everything‚Ä¶‚Äù* (HS Basil during a picnic. This is kind of a sad but funny dialogue because I am sure at one point this was true but it‚Äôs also Sunny being a lil goof in his head. Then again this is hikikomori route so Sunny hasn‚Äôt exactly been outside to see the insanity.)\n\n\nA big thing also is that the friends all react to him very differently. Sunny can tell when something is off but doesn‚Äôt know how to approach it (though in the end it‚Äôs hopeful he will have a better idea of what he needs to do). He is very careful with Basil and the two of them seem to be able to talk about anything. Sunny is scared of him though. I think he sees the darkness inside himself and because Basil is so close to what happened he can feel that uncomfortable feeling. He is definitely scared from the way Basil reacts when he is under intense stress and his frantic back and forths. This can be seen when he tries to leave the room. Note that it was not always this way as Basil stated he could go to Sunny about anything. \n\n\nAubrey can also tell and is seen to be very gentle with him until you meet her in the present time and she‚Äôs not happy‚Ä¶ at all. It should be noted that her emotions can definitely get in the way of this, but shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed that she is the one who recommended the group should stay the night at his house on One Day Left. She noticed him when he was acting strange after The Incident and tried to hangout with him to the point of begging to come over, and in Headspace, she cries at the thought he may be in danger and is worried to tears. I know Headspace isn‚Äôt reliable but I do believe it is an important detail because she cried on two separate occasions and was one of the last to forget about him. This shows me that Sunny knows they were close and that she would be worried if Headspace were to be taking place for real in the timeframe he is imagining. I personally believe that based on their closeness as children they were once very close and that‚Äôs why it really hit Aubrey hard when she thought Basil was a nutcase who scribbled out the photos. It would definitely hit hard for someone you really trusted to turn out to be a big goober. In the end he didn‚Äôt do that but he also did the other thing so I guess it balances out. However she did push him into the lake so there‚Äôs that too. That‚Äôs a lot of angry feelings for one person to have about another and typically it shows how much they meant to you before for you to feel so betrayed. Similar thoughts to her relationship with Kel and Sunny but that‚Äôs for another post.\n\n\nKel on the other hand, our sweet summer child, is often oblivious. He does notice when things are off and he is afraid to make them worse, but he really does have a habit of missing the big things. He doesn‚Äôt realize that Basil is having issues even to the point of stating,\n\n*‚ÄúYou just focus on going back to being your happy, carefree self!‚Äù* On Three Days left. He is completely unaware of what is actually brewing underneath but is also a very ‚ÄòTo Your Face‚Äô type of person and likely assumes that is how his friend will be and that his friend will be honest with him. Even Basil seems a little caught off guard with this one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢Back to Basil‚Ä¢**\n\nHe appreciates all of the traits his friends bring, but Sunny and him share a special bond that feels safe. This is why I can see them growing close because both of them have that inner turmoil but neither one of them is judging the other for it (to their face). This also leads to conflict as resentment can (and did) begin to boil over from their lack of being completely truthful and upfront with each other.¬†\n\n\nThis is a difficult thing for him to do anyway due to his worries he will be perceived as a bad person by himself and others. If Basil begins to think his actions are bad, then that causes him to have to work circles on whether or not someone else is bad, and the cycle continues leading to a confusion on how he really feels because he‚Äôs too afraid to actually feel those things.¬†\n\n\nHe avoids Sunny and Kel and rejects hanging out with them and is pretty curt with the ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù statement. It is in his mind that not only does he think he‚Äôs a bad person but he thinks Sunny believes this too and doesn‚Äôt want to place a burden on him. This is a common trend seen in his character, the word burden shows up constantly with him.\n\n\n\n*\"But somehow... whenever I try to help...\nI always end up burdening you instead.\"*\n\n\nAlright dude‚Ä¶ a little guilting but I‚Äôll let it slide.\n\nAnyways he isn't someone to blow up a lot and he's not going to freak out. Until he does. And when he does, it usually ends up pretty intense. It‚Äôs hard to properly gauge what his emotional explosions would be like considering we see him at one of the objectively worst times in his life, but from what OMOCAT has to say about his character and his history of repressing his true emotions that he, unlike Sunny at the current time of the game, knows are there, I can‚Äôt assume it will be good. There is just too much baggage that he tries to carry and he swings from one extreme to the other and it usually takes a lot to bring him to his breaking point, but even before that point, the issues he harbors internally only get worse with time.\n\n\n*‚ÄúHey... I'm really sorry to bring this up, but...Something has been really bothering me‚Ä¶‚Äù *-Headspace Basil trying to vent to Sunny but being really gentle about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢FANON vs CANON vs INTERPRETATION‚Ä¢**\n\n\nBasil is seen as kind of a wimp. He quick to cry, leans heavily on other people to unhealthy degrees, his emotions are extreme and everyone in the group notices, and is typically sad and pessimistic while loving flowers and talking sweetly and innocently about little things he likes. This, however, is not exactly Basil. Basil does depend on people to unhealthy degrees but he doesn‚Äôt make that known because he isn‚Äôt exactly proud of it. To some people, such as Sunny given the situation, he absolutely becomes desperate in an attempt to navigate the problem together given Sunny is directly involved and there isn‚Äôt anyone else to talk to about it. This isn‚Äôt how he is with the others though. He will hint, tip-toe, and unconfidently try to convey that he‚Äôs worried he is bothering someone with his presence but will not outright talk about his feelings unless he is at his complete limit which may come as a surprise to the person he is flipping out on. I do subscribe to the idea that he‚Äôs quick to cry though because Rowan was quick to cry and in many of his emotion profiles he is crying be it from anger, sadness, or even happiness. He doesn‚Äôt tend to cry in front of people though, he is more of the type to lock himself away in his room or the bathroom and try to organize his thoughts. He also isn‚Äôt always sad and pessimistic and most people who are suffering from mental health disorders are not either. It is seen from a majority of the flashbacks that he enjoys poking fun at his friends, having a good laugh, and enjoying the small things. In the current time, there aren't a lot of things to laugh about but this should be noted from the game.\n\n\n\n*‚ÄúHehe...‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúDon't worry about it. You'll find out soon enough.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúShhhh... Don't tell anyone, okay?\" -Basil being devious about poker.*\n\n\nOne last thing to touch up on in the analysis that‚Äôs very important is his codependency on other people. He wants people to like him and to care about him but he also isn‚Äôt used to it and as a result doesn‚Äôt know how to do it to a healthy degree himself. He has his grandmother and Polly, the latter of which he is cold to. His parents had dumped him off at his grandmother‚Äôs and Polly who had been there for either two years or three months depending on which dialogue you want to go off of, had only seen them one time and Sunny never.\n\n\nWhich is odd because they had spent a ton of time together. Like a lot.¬†\n\n\nFrom this, it can be gathered that he has some intense abandonment issues. He also may have gained a lot of (seen in general) feminine traits such as his enjoyment of hygiene (reminding Kel to wash his hands and telling his friends to white their feet off on the mat), gardening, photography, and wearing hair clips and dressing like his grandmother picks out his clothes. He is gentle and incredibly effective. Why? This guy was raised by a gardening grandma and grandma‚Äôs (most) don‚Äôt really enjoy when someone is messy or dressing weird. Seriously, my grandmother cried every time I cut my hair and would put me in these little outfits. I don‚Äôt know, this just makes sense to me.\n\n\nHe is also used to having his birthday missed as he assumed his friends had forgotten and was delighted to know they had surprised him instead. (grandma what are you doinnnnggg?? You better be giving this boy a birthday every single year ma‚Äôam. In all seriousness I‚Äôm sure she did celebrate. It was likely those darn absent parents of his that made him think this way.)\n\n\n*‚Äú(2/18 - MY BIRTHDAY): It's my 12th birthday today! I thought my friends forgot, but they all surprised me with a strawberry cake. I feel so lucky... This year is looking to be a good year!‚Äù*\n\n\nHe is a person who is terrified of losing anything which is why photographs are the perfect way to showcase this character. He loves his photography because he loves his friends and wants to hold them close and take care of them just like he takes care of his flowers. He is passionate about his hobbies (up until you meet him in the RW) and although there is this soft sweet side to him, there is also a side that is in VERY deep turmoil and pain that he hides.\n\n\n*‚ÄúIt's hard to remember now, but... I think... at the time...\nI took photos of what I was most afraid to lose.‚Äù*\n\n\nIn summary from this little spot, Basil is often boiled down to a few different traits but in reality is insanely complex!\n\n\nFanon- He's either Flower or Rowan essentially. Find baaalance. Idc if you headcanon him as whatever but if you‚Äôre trying to be accurate remember balance is key. I see people tap a little too far into plants sometimes or his other hobbies too. BALANCE MY FRIEND\n\n\nCanon- He's a nervous Flower but with Rowan lurking underneath (generalized)\n\n\nInterpretation- Whatever else you believe/headcanon\n\n\nBonus Personal Head canon no one asked for: I headcanon him as having some light scars after the encounter because they were slinging sharp shears all over the place.\n\n\n\n\n\n**‚Ä¢Random Facts and Things to Remember‚Ä¢**\n\nüå∫ It is stated by HS Aubrey that Basil is a very considerate person who wouldn‚Äôt just wander off without telling anyone. This shows that at least in the past it could be assumed that he thinks of his friends first before taking on an action such as disappearing for long periods of time.\n\n\nüå∫ He rejects hanging out with Sunny and Kel\n\n\nüå∫ He wasn't the one who scribbled out the photos and was crushed by it\n\n\nüå∫ He was neglecting his hobbies when we meet him in RW\n\nüåº In the beta it is stated his favorite food is Tofu\n\nüåº He AND HIS GRANDMA have a staring problem.\n\nüåº Snow makes him sad¬†\n\n*‚ÄúH-Huh? Oh... It's nothing!‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúSorry... It's kind of silly.‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúI don't know why... but snow makes me really sad.‚Äù*\n\n\nüåπ He is NOT an honest person. This isn‚Äôt to say he is a huge liar liar pants on fire, but he definitely lies. For example, he will NOT tell Aubrey that you think dying her hair pink is a bad idea if you answer ‚Äúno‚Äù when prompted. This is actually kind of sweet.\n\n*‚ÄúWhat do you think, SUNNY?‚Äù*\n\n*‚ÄúHmm... Maybe we shouldn't tell AUBREY that.‚Äù*\n\n‚Äî\n*‚ÄúDon't worry... I know I can always tell you guys anything.‚Äù -Basil, who is lying.¬†*\n\n(I do think he genuinely meant he could tell his friends things, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean he will. Aubrey had to press him to actually answer.)\n__\n\nüåπ HS Aubrey mentions he would not like a gambling joint.\n\n\nüåº Kel mentions he has a weak stomach\n\n\nüå∫ He does not like his shots being terrorized by Hector and his shenanigans¬†\n\n\nüåπ He knows that you need a good poker face when playing the game\n\n\nüåº Kel in HS outs him for being good with a camera and puts him on the spot. He doesn‚Äôt seem to like this or have the confidence to take a photo and mumbles: ‚ÄúKel‚Ä¶ why‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n\nüå∫ He likes spiders because they help him with his garden and Kel once again offers him up and puts him on the spot to try and calm a terrified Hero. He is once again doubtful of himself but talks at lengths of their benefits anyway.\n\n\nüåπ He says ‚Äúah‚Äù All the time.\n\n\nüåº He likes things that are cute. He‚Äôs called Sunny and Mari cute as well as Aubrey. Sorry Kel.\n\n\nüå∫ Dude is pretty mentally strong for going so long like this but is also a very haunted person\n\n\nüåπ Was planning his suicide since before we see him\n\n\nüåº It is mentioned he is a very forgiving person\n\n\n\nüå∫ Calls Aubrey ‚ÄúAubrey-Chan‚Äù in Japanese version as she is actively bullying him showing his idealization problem \n\n\nüåπ Aubrey straight thinks he is helpless and needs defended (HS) In RW he needs defending from her lol.\n\n\nüåº He's somewhat outgoing and a little too optimistic but it's usually a front. Not always, but usually. He just has an innocent outlook. Picture a traumatized stuffed animal.\n\n\n\nPointless stuff ghost of hallownest, me, and the fox mod will probably like: \n\n*‚ÄúAh! I'm sorry, AUBREY. I just thought you looked cute! I'll show you when it's ready.‚Äù*\n\n\n*(Not a huge point but funny thing is he‚Äôs called her cute, Hero straight outted Kel and told Aubrey that Kel used to think she was cute, and Sunny thinks she‚Äôs cute. Possible love triangle? Jk‚Ä¶. Maybe. NYAHAHAHAHA. I‚Äôm insane. Aubrey is confirmed universally adorable though!‚Äù*\n\n\n\nAnyway I have a whole other half to this but tumblr copy and paste is balls. Okay that‚Äôs all thanks please share your thoughts ",

Here are Basil's good traits, here are Basil's not-so-good traits, and here are, wow, Basil's terrible and unhealthy traits. But all of this is presented mostly without any context whatsoever. And it seems like it's all focused on the game itself, specific quotes and points from Omocat's interviews about Basil are provided, and there are even points I'm willing to agree with, but it feels like most of the things in the post, especially those related to recent events in the game, still have an explanation, and a pretty reasonable and comprehensive one, but I haven't explicitly noticed it in the text. It's like there's a massive elephant in the room that's being ignored, which anyone who has even attempted to analyze the true reasons behind Basil's state and behavior will notice. I was quite surprised that even after reading the entire post, I didn't find any reasonable explanation for Basil's behavior.\n\nI don't know if the author intended to do this deliberately, but I got the impression that the author is even indirectly blaming Basil for the fact that due to a terrible trauma, he couldn't withstand psychological pressure and as a result acquired those traits that will severely hinder him in life, be it avoidance, emotional instability, etc. I didn't see any emphasis in the text that Basil's strange, problematic behavior has a specific and clear explanation and that Basil cannot be blamed for having these problems, precisely because of the presence of this explanation. Conclusions about Basil's character are drawn mostly from the post-traumatic period in his life, about his actions, deeds, words already during the period when he suffered from pathological psychological disorders, without preliminary analysis of how strongly the trauma affected the boy's character, which is already not very correct. Psychological disorders and diseases are not an integral part of character, since without the occurrence of a traumatic background, these disorders would not have manifested at all and would not have fundamentally affected a person's character. For Basil, psychological trauma is the root cause of anxiety, depression, emotional instability, avoidance, etc., everything else is a consequence. I didn't see this thought in the text, but I really would have liked to.\n\nIt would have been worth at least separately mentioning that the undoubtedly unhealthy aspects of Basil's behavior manifested **only after he suffered a severe psychological trauma**, and this elephant in the room would disappear. We will understand that Basil had objective reasons for why he seems whiny, why he avoids friends and Polly, why his mind clouds over and he falls into a psychotic episode on the night before Sunny's departure, etc. I don't think OP is unaware that the psychological trauma associated with Mari's death fundamentally broke his character and made this boy even more vulnerable, but I just didn't see an emphasis on this in the text, which, from my point of view, is wrong.\n\nOtherwise, the post really has valuable thoughts, there is a desire to understand, albeit not without flaws and (possibly unintentional) omissions.",

Their birthday is coming up within the next 3 weeks, and I am trying to work together with a composer friend to make the best Friday Night Funkin- style song possible to give them as a gift. I'm having trouble nailing down exactly what parts of the story I want to include in this song though, so I would appreciate some advice on what events and songs I should reference throughout it! So far, this part linked in the post will be Sunny and Omori in the white space, then I was thinking I would do a section in the dream world with Omori and all his friends, followed by a section with \"something\", then take a dark turn and reference Mari's demise. Any thoughts would be appreciated! ",

My friend warned me that the *ENDING* was pretty damn heavy and that i had to be careful not to let the game get too much into my head because It could have ripercussions on my mental health,and well...After around 1 hour of game time (arrived when i got to play with Sunny) i literally started cryng A LOT for 10 minutes straight and i couldnt stop. And i didnt even start the fucking game.\nWhat i wanna ask Is,how cooked am i? And also,should i continue playng the game?",

The warnings are there for a reason. Just take it easy. Save with the picnic baskets. Or, if possible, play with your friend? I generally find playing with friends helps a lot. If you do end up \"quitting\" the game, you can probably watch a playthrough on YouTube, I found the extra distance (playing it yourself vs. watching another person play it) helps with that. I hope this helps, I didn't want to spoil anything, so good luck with playing/watching.",

I‚Äôm not too sure. because it goes either in a direction where Sunny doesn‚Äôt lock himself away for 4 years, still comes out, but Basil is the only one he really talks to, which is largely more healthy for them both. odds are the photo album never gets ruined, meaning Aubrey even though she‚Äôd be distant she‚Äôd never end up bullying Basil or feeling any prejudice against Sunny (assuming it‚Äôs a scenario where he doesn‚Äôt stay inside for 4 years).\n\nif he did isolate himself but remained open enough to remain with Basil I imagine it would just be Basil going over to Sunny‚Äôs house very often, the Sunflower shipper in me finds that to be pretty cute lmao.\n\nin terms of the games story itself, either way it would change pretty drastically, Basil wouldn‚Äôt be as depressed, I think they‚Äôd both be less suicidal because they‚Äôll confide in each other. chances are the truth would never come out because it only originally came out as a result of Sunny not wanting himself or Basil to harbour such a secret anymore, and his friends deserve to know.\n\nin terms of Sunny moving away I‚Äôm not too sure, odds are just because him and Basil remained super close friends throughout the 4 years probably wouldn‚Äôt change the fact Sunny‚Äôs mom wants them to move to the city, and 4 years of being together maybe Basil wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle that lol",

It's not like everyone who played it got depression or anything like that, but it's not the most relaxing or comforting experience either.\n\nFrom the Steam page: \"This game contains depictions of depression, anxiety, and suicide, and may not be suitable for all audiences. It also contains bright flashing imagery that may cause discomfort and/or seizures for those with photosensitive epilepsy. Viewer discretion is advised.\"\n\nIt's a great game with awesome story and characters, but respect your own boundaries if you think it's not for you.",

This is inevitable regardless of the circumstances. Perhaps, because they would believe Mari died in an accident rather than by suicide, they would feel less guilt, as in their minds it wouldn't be related to their actions or Mari's. The grief would still be colossal, but the focus would shift towards the accidental nature of the event rather than the personal guilt of each friend stemming from Mari‚Äôs perceived actions. But in any case, the feelings of guilt and grief among everyone would still be immense. The realization of the truth, when revealed to their friends, wouldn't be any easier than in the canon, since Sunny and Basil would have lied about an accidental fall down the stairs just as they lied about suicide.\n\n**In conclusion:** nothing would drastically change. The friends would experience slightly less personal guilt, but they would still experience immense grief over the loss of a dear and close one, even in the case of an accident.\n\n**Bonus question answer:** in Headspace, the focus would probably be more on lying about an accidental tragedy rather than suicide, and the related imagery would be more about falling down a flight of stairs rather than hanging. How exactly they would look like would be up to the players' imaginations and headcanons.",

    "selftext": "Kel being angry and the truth ending would be kinda satisfying. Sure it‚Äôs out of character but think about it. He lived under the influence that Mari had taken her life (like the others did) and because of that he tried to get everyone to be happy again and move on. What did he get for that? He had an argument with his older brother which stuck with him. Sure, hero was in a rough place 100% and I don‚Äôt blame hero for the argument at all but what‚Äôs important is that it happened and Kel (nor hero) had ill intentions at all. \n\nHe also lost Aubrey, she became friends with a group of bad kids and her and Kel had a fall out. I don‚Äôt really know about him and Basil but I think I heard that Basil had started avoiding him. \n\nKel being angry could also work because of his coping mechanisms, toxic positivity. Toxic positivity can only last so long. He has been holding it for 4 years. The truth scene would be the perfect time for Kel to let loose and genuinely get upset. \n\nAs I do think this is OOC for Kel the idea is still kinda interesting to me. Like, what if the stages of grief hero, Kel and Aubrey represented switched after the truth? Like\n\nHero accepts what happens \nAubrey is depressed about it\nAnd Kel is mad",

He would feel bad for what Basil and Sunny had been through, since Sunny moved away he'd probably try to be there for Basil as much as he can (considering that they probably discover about his attempt at some point, since him and Sunny had to give some sort of explanation about what happened).

First of all sunny is already in so much pain both because of the basil exchange and the whole 4 years living with this truth so Kel (being an empathetic person especially after spending time with sunny after so long) would not express rage after this. Second of all, Kel is already shaken by this whole basil sunny thing, he wouldn't be able to process this immediately anyway. That being said, I think if we think everyone will forgive them then I believe Kel would be the last one to forgive, I can't explain exactly why but it feels like that. He has the highest chance to forgive(to me), but it will take a long time for him, where hero and Aubrey *might* overcome this fact with hero being emotionally grown and Aubrey realising how important being by your friends side in a few days.",

    "selftext": "I've seen theories from YouTube and here about Omori is representing Sunny's Super or alter Ego and how the headspace is the ID from Alferd Fryod's theory, which has good evidence and I actually like that theory but I think there's more of who Omori is and what he's representing.\n\nA few weeks ago I was studying in art history class discussing about the Renaissance era where artists experiments art using religion, symbolism and storytelling in their art work. One of the works that struck me the most is Holy Trinity by Masaccio. The reason why it kept my eye on it is there some text in it that has mentioned one word and that is Momento mori.\n\nThe Definition of Momento Mori in Latin means \"Remember you must die\" this term has been used for Christianity or Catholic tradition in order to be ready for you death and not fear it. If you seperate the two words, it gives you to two definitions Momento means reminder of the past and Mori means remind of mortality. The word has been associated with visual arts and is mostly common with skulls, coffin, hourglass and even Wilting Flowers to signify the impermanence of life.\n\nSo what does it have to do with Omori?\nMy theory is that Sunny has created Omori by practicing his reflection on his mortality ever since Mari's death and has been trying to remember on what happened due to the trauma blocking his memory. There is a possible case that his family was either religious at the time before the accident (which is why you see Mari's grave is at the church) so maybe Sunny has some experience with it. In headspace Basil's flowers will start to decay because of his absent, they eventually died out once you finish headspace. There's also the coffin of Mari once you reach to the stairs. In blackspace you'll manage to find the church in the final door. Finally the final boss. In Omori's dialogue he blames you for Mari's death and tells you that you should've just died. What all of this means is Omori is telling Sunny that he should've died in the first place instead of Mari and he should be ready to accept his faith, this could be interpreting Sunny is telling himself he needs to die and must face the consequences for what he did. In the bad ending that's what happened. \n\nThat's the theory I have of what Omori is representing. I know my theory isn't perfect but it has connections I've noticed. I hope you enjoy my fun theory and I would like to hear you guys opinion about this!",

It was different compared to the rest of the soundtrack and it was only played in one particular spot - the outside of the stump.

It's hands down my favorite game of all time and I've never felt this way to any other game or media. Sadly, you can't just forget things on command, and I don't plan on getting amnesia any time soon, so I just have to bear with the truth.\n\nIf they ever invent a memory gun (like for example the one in Gravity Falls), I'm definitely writing a paper note saying \"Play OMORI!\" and erasing all memory of it to just look at the note experience it play it again.",

    "selftext": "All head canons are welcome, I just wanna hear everyone‚Äôs headcanons for characters, even if you don‚Äôt actually have a reason for it and just like the headcanon!! I‚Äôm just curious on what others think!! \n\nHere‚Äôs mine: (sorry it‚Äôs so much-)\n\nSunny/Omori: The shortest out of the whole group from malnutrition. Was underweight for a while, mainly cause he wasn‚Äôt eating properly during the 4 years he shut himself out. Grew his hair out Post game, but only to about his shoulders. He is Genderfluid, He/They/She, doesn‚Äôt care what pronouns someone uses and his gender changes usually every few weeks! He‚Äôs pansexual, doesn‚Äôt care about what gender a person is if he likes them. He had a crush on Aubrey and Kel at different points in his life. He has (and eventually got diagnosed with) PTSD, Autism, Schizophrenia. (Idk if this is canon or disproven but-) His parents were slightly neglectful specifically towards his mental, emotional, physical health- usually leaving it to Mari but it especially got worse after Mari‚Äôs death. Ever since the event- his brain will black out certain memories despite his photographic memories. Post game- he has prosthetic eyes and eyes patches. His favorite ones to wear is the purple eye(for Mari), white eye(his favorite color), or a plain white eye patch. He basically started living with Kel post game. \n\nMari: If she was still alive, she‚Äôd be the 3rd shortest of the group. I think she‚Äôd be a Cis woman, She/Her pronouns. But her sexuality would be Heteromantic Asexual. Her Parents always had high expectations for her (which I think is canon?). If she was still alive, she‚Äôd be either a teacher or a Pianist. Possiblya Piano Teacher! \n\nBasil: The middle of the group, not the tallest, and not the shortest. Also, a bit muscular from how much he gardens. Grew out his hair to about mid back, usually wears it in a low ponytail. Dyed the tips of hair teal after Sunny told the group about Headspace. Has different nature tattoos throughout his body, most of them represent his friends. He‚Äôs a Demiboy, He/They pronouns. But he‚Äôs also AroAce. He once thought he had a crush on Sunny. He was diagnosed with PTSD, Autism, Anxiety and Borderline Personality Disorder. Sunny is his favorite person and has been for years. He bought Sunny different flower eyepatches, Sunny tends to wear the Sunflower one when they‚Äôre together. Him and Aubrey rented an apartment together at 18. Went to college for Botany and Photograpy. Started a side gig of Photography for extra money, and also worked at a Flower shop. Eventually opened up his own flower shop that Sunny occasionally helps around in. \n\nAubrey: The second shortest of the group, taller than Sunny but not taller than Basil. Cut her hair to her lower neck. Her tips are pink, but her side front hair pieces are purple to after hearing about headspace Mari. Got a matching tattoo with Kim on her right wrist and another on her ankle of a piano. Picked up a hippie type style in college for a while. Cis Woman as well, but She/They pronouns. She‚Äôs Bisexual, no preference in either direction. Was diagnosed with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. The second person in the group to talk to Sunny and Basil again but the first to properly forgive them. When she found out the truth, she was extremely angry at them, and wanted to attack them but instead quickly left out so she wouldn‚Äôt. Picked up Piano in College to ‚Äúhonor‚Äù Mari. Became a Teacher. \n\nKel: The second tallest out of the group and most muscular. Grew his hair out to about upper back, wears it mainly have up and half down. He wears kind of a lazy athlete style in college. Usually wearing a hoodie or jacket over some basketball shorts. Cis Man, He/They and I headcanon him a Bi-curious- but in the opposite direction! He knows he likes boys but he‚Äôs unsure how he feels about girls. He was diagnosed with ADHD! I have a headcanon that the real reason (I haven‚Äôt played in a while- I don‚Äôt know if this is canon) he jumped to acceptance so quickly is because he wasn‚Äôt that close to Mari- and felt it wasn‚Äôt his place to feel sad about it. He basically didn‚Äôt think his feelings matter much. Was the first one to talk to Basil and Sunny again but the last one to forgive them(not because he didn‚Äôt want to- but because he tried to ignore his feelings about the situation cause he didn‚Äôt think they mattered as much as Sunny and Basil‚Äôs). He tried being the glue to the group and continued to overwhelm himself. He ended up with eyebags in college because of it. He became a basketball Coach. \n\nHero: The tallest in the group. He started keeping his hair short and rarely lets it grow out. He doesn‚Äôt have a specific style. Cis man, He/Him. Aromantic Demisexual. He started out as Demisexual, but became Aromantic after Mari‚Äôs death because of the trauma he got from it. Was the last person to talk to them again but the second one to forgive. He wasn‚Äôt angry or sad when he first found out about the truth- he was more disappointed in himself and partially blamed himself for not being there for them. He had closed himself out for a while, while he thought over everything. Eventually became a therapist but does cooking as a hobby. ",

        "body": "well, i did play omori when i was 13 (i‚Äôm currently 15) so i think i can share my personal experience with it\n\nit‚Äôd probably be different for you because most of my weird problems with it came from the fact that unfortunately, i used to hang out with some bad people that turned me into a bad person too, i only realised how many years i‚Äôd waisted last year and i‚Äôm still coping with some remnants of that old me. it‚Äôs not like i didn‚Äôt have empathy or anything, i was just an asshole to people, i‚Äôd easily get angry, i was selfish etc. but anyways, when i first played omori i LOVED it. it‚Äôs still actually one of my favourite games alongside ddlc, deltarune and va11halla. however there were some aspects of it that i didn‚Äôt really understand that were pretty obvious. basically, there were a few things that you were very obviously meant to deduct but i was just too unexperienced with indie games and too stupid to get it. so what i‚Äôm trying to say is, i don‚Äôt know you, but if you don‚Äôt think of yourself as someone fairly mature, then i‚Äôd recommend you waiting for at least like a year. keep in mind though that teen years are very different for everyone so who knows, maybe i‚Äôm actually the one who should be asking you for advices haha. another thing worth mentioning is the fact that omori is a psychological horror and covers some very serious and heavy topics. there are scenes that disturb even the older audience so if you‚Äôre going through some tough times or in general you know that even if fiction, some things can impact your mental state, i would also suggest waiting this year or two.\n\nthe first playthrough of omori was a life changing experience for many, including me. at the end of the day, you‚Äôre the one who knows yourself the best and the final decission belongs to you, but everyone in the omori community wants the newcomers to have a magical time playing the game so please be mindful. some indie games i can recommand you that you can play in the mean time are celeste, hollow knight, oneshot, outcore, undertale, deltarune and ib (about the other games 2 i‚Äôd mentioned earlier uhh, you should probably wait another year for them ._.).\n\nhope i helped at least a little bit and have a nice day Ôøº‚Äã",

She ended up passing in the hospital.. I won‚Äôt go into graphic detail, because it‚Äôs pretty graphic, but no one is really blaming the eldest son. The family is devastated, and so is the eldest son. He has crippling guilt because of it, but no one is blaming him because it really was just a tragic accident. Everyone would be very upset, but there‚Äôs a really distinct line between accidentally shoving your sister down the stairs and killing her, calling the ambulance or fessing up to it, and accidentally shoving your sister down the stairs and killing her then also hanging her to cover your tracks. Hero would get depressed, Aubrey wouldn‚Äôt actually be as angry as she‚Äôs depicted to be in the present. Aubrey really loved Sunny back then and actually had quite the crush on him, both Kel and Aubrey and Basil would ultimately forgive him, tho Basilwould still be in denial. All in all, it would take Hero a little bit more time for him to get over it or for him to forgive Sunny, but he would, because he didn‚Äôt hide it, and he told the truth. It hits a whole lot harder when he does hide it, hides away, and doesn‚Äôt tell the truth.",

I don't know why you people are surprised these posts pop. Every single subreddit of any game that's at least a year old has this and nothing can stop it cause its only natural. Plus, I dunno if you know this, but if you're really so adamant on quality control, Imma let you in on a lil somethin.

Then boom there was the video, calling me beckoning me to watch it, I originally intended to just have it in the background as I drew some art to post in my twitter but after just after watching the start of it I knew I had to buckle down and watch the whole thing. Nearly cry several times but I managed to actually keep my tears in, since I didn't want to cry  (I ended up crying the day after watching the video). And after watching it I just began watching anything with Omori in the title, specially animations and meme compilation, and finally I couldn't take it anymore and bought the game yesterday.

    "selftext": "Omocat has done nothing to support her playerbase outside of Japan and the US. I can excuse Kmanga because those are Kodansha's practices, but the PS Store, Xbox store, hell her own store. Either OMORI content isn't available or it has downright overpriced shipping costs. And you know I could excuse this if not for the fact that A: There is console exclusive content and B: The game has sold AT LEAST 1 million copies in the past 4 years. Where's all that money going to Omocat?! WHERE IS IT?!\n\nTl;dr: No support for non Japanese and American fans makes me sad\n\nEdit: It's physically impossible for me to be a westerner when I'm Asian guys üò≠üò≠üò≠ What are y'all on??? Did you forget that countries exist outside of Japan, America and the countries in Europe?",

The Omori shirts don't, to my knowledge, accommodate for 42in chests etc, so I can't even buy shirts to wear and express love for the game. \n\nI love Omori and have purchased it twice (PC and Switch) but yeah I totally get your gripes",

As the potion exists as a way to reminince on the cut concepts for gender-swaps, it is more-or-less just showing off a piece of that idea they cut. Similar reason why the effect ceases outside of walking around, as there are no sprites for the other actions.\n\nDue to the fact that there's nothing else implying anything regarding that, your assumption is on a very shaky foundation.

    "selftext": "First of all, no, I am not going to highlight anything about the game by saying that it is a masterpiece of psychology and I will not look for symbolism where there is none, I will not hesitate to highlight the bad points of the game, although I will try to take into account the good things ...so you could say I'm a hater\n\nAnd since I'm a hater, if you want you can ignore what I'll say and just go down and give me the downvote that I deserve for not having the opinion of the majority or for not understanding the super ultra deep and super giga mega realistic psychology of the game, now lets start:\n\nAh... Omori, the 99999 indie RPG videogame inspired by Earthbound made in RPG maker, I won't mention the exaggerated production time of 6 years (because come on, in RPG maker you can literally make a videogame in 2 days) \n\nthe things that most attracts my attention are: the plot, which is 50/50 for me due to the plot holes that not even the fandom can explain no matter how many mental jerks they made, the characters, the narrative, the structure of the game/Gameplay and the controversies of Omocat ...which I'm not going to include because I feel like it would be very unfair to the game's opportunity to defend itself. \n\n‚Ä¢Plot: I must say that... I liked it, yeah, I found it sentimental and everything, but just because a game makes you cry doesn't make it a masterpiece, it just means that you became very attached to it. The plot, looking at it more closely, is very disastrous, I must say that the idea of a child who becomes a hermint (or as they call it here: hikkikomori) due to a trauma he had 4 years ago for killing his big sister, and that before moving out he goes out to see what's up with his friends and seeing that his mistake made everyone's life miserable, is a plot that would be very interesting... but we are going wrong in some things, first: the cover-up of Mari's death. I have many thoughts with this scene, because the presentation is very good, I like how they used the film technique of \"showing and not telling\" narrating everything with the photos, making it clear what happened, but still leaving some mysteries like... What did Sunny and Mari discuss? What was Sunny and Basil's first reactions? and others like that... but nothing is perfect and there are also errors. The scene stops being good after Sunny kills Mari, because I must say that it was a very creative way to put the burden of killing a loved one on Sunny's shoulders, *but* everything goes to hell when they cover it up by hanging her. .. I mean... why didn't they call an ambulance? Why didn't they say that she tripped on her broken knee while she was holding the violin and she fell on it? At 12 years old it is an age in which it is unlikely to think of something as crazy as hanging someone and on top of that knowing how to tie a hangman's knot, and I know they are going to defend this by saying that they were just scared children and all, but tell me your ...if you were in the same situation, would you do the same?   \n\nEverything continues to get worse with the fact that everyone swallows that lie, I mean... did everyone care that Mari had fall injuries? Well, apparently no... and they simply accepted the idea that she killed herself, and let's not even talk about the apparent nonexistence of the police in the game, because with a single autopsy, Sunny and Basil's entire plan would fell down, and yes, I see you writing that they made that whole mess because they were *scared little kids and I don't know what and memememe*... I mean, bro... justify all this by saying that \"they were just scared kids\" it even seems like a comedy (it makes me laugh a little that when the characters are 12 years old, they act as if they were 8, and when they are 16, they act as if they were 12 lol) in my mind I proposed to fix things (in a slightly cheap way, but in my opinion better) and it is that they would call an ambulance, and while they are in a hospital room there with Sunny's friends, seeing Mari dead, obviously sad, a policeman interrogates Basil to find out what's up with everything, and Basil, under the pressure of the interrogation, he invents the stupidity that Mari killed herself by jumping from the second floor (which I think would make sense due to the injuries from the fall) and that the police did not buy it and decided to investigate further, but that the others trust, because Basil would have a reputation for not lie, and with this the scene where Sunny tells the truth would have a little more symbolism, because the lie would end right where it started: in the hospital   \n\nbut hey, we are criticizing Omori, not making fanficts, right? anyway...   \n\n‚Ä¢Characters: well, let's start with the protagonist, the fandom's favorite TraumaBoy: Sunny. I don't know how to feel about Sunny (nah its a lie, I hate this guy to death). Firstly, his attitude, Sunny is the greatest romanticization of depression and introverts that I have ever seen, with his exaggeratedly reserved attitude that would not last any second in real life, with his clothing which is designed solely to expose his body as much as possible with the intention of attracting degenerate shotacon fans, and the fact that they use the biggest cliche of depressed people: carrying a knife everywhere for no reason. Sunny shows no interest in helping his friends or getting Aubrey back into the group, and what's more... he even hurts them, like when he stabbed Aubrey (yes, I know it's because he was far away from reality at that moment and blah blah blah) but Sunny seems very proud of having given a knife wound to whoever is apparently his crush, and here we have another absence from the police force, because no one in the park deigned to call the police. authorities, and we are even worse with his psychopath behavior, like when he cut open Mewo apparently for pleasure, or the simple fact that he decided to carry a knife in the first place (I mean... why?) and yes, I know that isolation It can cause psychopathy but if Sunny really loved his friends so much, to the point of having a fantasy world where he has adventures with them, he should show them a little empathy, right?...right...?  \n\nWe are also bad with the fact that he is... very selfish.  \n\nHe was selfish since he hanged his own sister that he \"loved a lot\" just to save himself, he was selfish by leaving Basil hallucinating in the bathroom, and he is selfish with the simple fact that... well, Sunny doesn't seem to like being with his friends, he always seems bitter and barely plays with them, and if Sunny doesn't like being alone, technically he would just want company to satisfy that personal emptiness, but not in an empathetic way because he only wants people around him for his pleasure... which as I said... is a bit selfish.  \n\nLet's not even talk about how he is immeasurably stoic, he doesn't smile, and not because of some illness, he literally says that he never liked to smile, he says it so clearly and directly that it would be funny to interpret it in another way... and yes, I see you writing that thing about him being autistic... no, Sunny is not autistic, that is a headcanon that you took from some body orifice, because that is not canon, let's remember that autism is delays in some mental aspects such as speech, thinking, expressions... and Sunny does not present any of those symptoms (just that he does not speak) and if he really were autistic, it would be more of an excuse to justify his behavior than because they really wanted to make an autistic character, and I know you will tell me that \"autistic people don't like to smile in photos\", but this is a backfire very very strong, because Basil said that he likes to take photos when no one is looking to capture \"their natural behavior\", at some point he had to catch Sunny with a smile, right?. If I'm honest, Sunny gives me more vibes of being emo, I mean... come on, he always dressed in black (even before the incident) he never smiles by choice, he is always serious, he carries a knife for no reason... come on bro... he is shouting from the rooftops that he is an emo, besides, when I see his face I don't feel that he is sad, nor depressed, nor sleepy, he seems rather \"bored\" or one of those people who say \"meh\" to everything. \n\nAnd this fandom makes me laugh if I'm honest, with people who say they identify with Sunny... I mean... it's possible to identify with this empty character? come on... if anyone bothered to read this, tell me ...how do you identify with Sunny? that are you a dwarf? that you are paler than Samara Morgan? that you carry a knife for no reason? that you are bitter just because? that you are a burden to your friends? that you are selfish? that everything scare you?   \nokay okay, im sorry... I'm being very harsh, but come on, this is true, if I ask you why you like Sunny, most likely you'll say it's because you feel bad for him or because his design is cute, but that's a very vague reason to like a character, and it only confirms that he's terribly written. If I asked someone here why they like Sunny, they'd probably just say it's because he looks cute and because he suffered a lot, but other than that... do you think he'd be a good friend? an empty person who barely speaks and barely comes out to play with you? It is very clear that Sunny got his friends because of Mari, not because of him, because Sunny has no charm other than acting like a generic introverted anime character, which, as I said: it wouldn't last any second in real life.   \n\nBut this is all good, right? Because it's supposed to be a story about someone who made a mistake and is redeeming himself, and it's understandable that he's despicable if that's the intention... right?   \n\nno, unfortunately not.   \n\nthe game desperately tries to make you feel bad for Sunny, when he faces his guilt in the final battle the game treats it as something sad, when he matures it treats it as something sad, and even when he tells the truth it treats it as something sad. None of this is sad, it's something that Sunny had to go through and it's not sad, it's a moment of will and determination, why the hell are you playing that bittersweet piano music for me? It should have uplifting music because Sunny for the first time in his miserable life does something morally correct. The game would be fine if it made it clear to us that Sunny is responsible for everything and that he knows it, and that he must mature to face what he did... but no, the game treats him as if he were the victim of everything, which it obviously is not; I highly doubt that his friends will forgive him after telling the truth, because... let's be honest, no one would react calmly to a such bucket of cold water, and I even think that since Sunny confessed what happened, he would even go to jail, he I would move on, but move on the road to the correctional facility lmao (I can already imagine Metroman telling him: \"going somewhere, besides jail?). Wow, Sunny almost stole this part, right? Well, let's talk about the stereotypical tomboy bully: Aubrey (or Auby as they call her here) I liked her, yeah, I liked her, her version of Headspace made me very very *very* cringe but the Faraway one seemed like a complete 180¬∞ turn that I liked, she was rude, violent, and obviously they presented her as a villain, without ridiculous justifications... or well that's what I thought, because after Sunny let out his inner beast and attacked her, her next appearance at the church left a bad taste in my mouth. Let's see... Everything is fine until the parishioners start criticizing her; I am a Christian, and it doesn't bother me that they represent us as villains, for example: I loved the character of Claude Frollo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but here? religious fanaticism is handled in such a poor way that I even have doubts if Omocat put it in because he has something against the church, because the dialogues and whispers that were thrown at Aubrey were very \"XD\"... I mean, for example:   \n\n\"Even since her father left, she is so uncontrollable, disrespectful, I feel bad for her mother\"   \n\nI mean... bro, did you just say that her father abandoned her and you proceed to criticize her? I mean... I know we are hypocrites but not that much lol. And as always, there is never a shortage of those who say that \\*this is very very very very realistic, that it is more realistic than the graphics of an RTX just because it is by Omori and that it is a masterpiece and I don't know what and mememememe\\*. But anyway, the character declines more when on the last day, we go to her house and I'm supposed to feel bad for her difunctional home... I mean, yes, of course it makes me sad to see someone living like that in the real life, but in Omori, this seems more like a way to make Aubrey look misunderstood make you forgive her actions, and it gets worse when with an intervention by Kel, Sunny and Hero in her room (or rather attic) Aubrey becomes part of the group apparently with the \"power of friendship\", I mean... bruh. If I were Aubrey, and the people I had a grudge against for 4 years broke into my house, the first thing I would do would be grab my nail bat and threat them; Ahhh but that doesn't matter because this is a symbolism of I don't know what in real life and that's why it's very realistic and I don't know what and mememememe. I have no problems with Kel, Hero and Basil, or at least none worth mentioning. The only character I really liked was Mari, and she's honestly my favorite; I never had an older sister, I was the first child and I have a younger sister, and I identify with her in trying to be outstanding and responsible (Yeah! I'm a boy who identifies with a girl character, any problem?), although hey, we are not talking about my life.   \nI admit it, I cried a little in Final Duet, but not for Sunny, but for Mari, you can see that she was a very good person and Sunny, in his selfishness, killed her, Mari also has her blunders (like when she overexploited Sunny with the violin) but it is clear that she always had good intentions and although it ended in tragedy, she just wanted her brother to stop being so lazy, which is something very justifiable. And I feel bad for her since her reputation and memory was stained by Sunny in his selfish attempt to save himself (because yes, Sunny regretted killing her but I don't see that he regretted hanging her) and well... nothing more to say here.   \n\n‚Ä¢Narrative: well, we already burned the characters a lot... now let's move on to the narrative, which is honestly regrettable at a certain point. Remember when I said at the beginning that I liked how in the revelation of how Mari died they used the \"show and don't tell\" technique? Well, everything goes to waste now, because it's the only time the game narrates something well. Let's put everything on the table: you just got out of the fight with Aubrey in the church I already talked about, then you go to the cementery and see Mari's grave, you get close and a cutscene activates, and then... SURPRISE! now Kel will tell you the whole old testament about how Hero got depressed and locked himself up for 1 year, I mean... this is too anticlimactic, during the whole scene I didn't feel bad for Hero or Kel, I was just like: \"did I asked you?\" and that is a problem with the game, they threw away the \"show and don't tell\" thing and now they are with a \"tell and don't show\", yes it is true that this depressed Hero theme is too irrelevant to be worth it give it a cinematic, so it would be nice if instead of Kel telling you everything in a random and anticlimactic moment, it would be nice to have some hints from Kel's parents and some dialogue from Hero in some moment of trust alone with Sunny. And it's not just this one, it's also when at the end of day 1, we return the album to Basil and look at the photos, and in the photo where Sunny is playing with a Gameboy on the couch... SURPRISE! Now Basil tells you the whole 1000 nights of sodom and explains in that same photo how Sunny is actually just shy and lets people have vent with him and I don't know what and memememe. It's very easy for me to interpret that Sunny threatened Basil into writing something positive about him on the album... and come on, it's not hard to imagine him doing that. And I have to rely on these dialogues to think that Sunny is actually a good friend, but for me he doesn't even care that his friends \"vent\" with him... and why? Well, do you remember that scene with the swings on the last day? where Aubrey talks to Sunny? Well, while Aubrey tells her her sorrows, Sunny cares three hectares of beans and just swings, totally ignoring her; What difference would it make if in the past he didn't ignore them in the same way? while supposedly doing them a favor by listening to them? Having to rely on text boxes is something that bothers me, because the actions of the characters in the game tell me something else, and it's made worse by the way the game deals with suicide and depression. I must admit that the trauma is portrayed VERY WELL, but the suicide and depression is terrible here. First of all, let's go with the Suicide: well, it's like Sunny really likes to self-kill, right? I mean, he kills himself in white space every moment to wake up, and yes, it's okay that they wanted to bring up the topic that when we die in a dream, we wake up in real life, but why not make him wake up once every time those moments with Stranger or that he remembers something? instead of sending us to Whitespace to watch Omori stab himself? It seems a little too edgy to me, besides... when Sunny kills himself in real life, the game AGAIN does it just to feel sorry for him, both when he stabs himself in the neutral ending and when he jumps out of the hospital in the Bad ending , to me it feels very... meh, the fact that they romanticize suicide as some kind of lifestyle is very offensive to me if someone here really suffers from suicidal thoughts, I could even say that Sunny has a kind of paraphilia with stab himself in the stomach. And well, what about depression? It seems that they portrayed it with their feet, and I doubt that Omocat firstly investigated what depression was like before making the game, I mean... when Sunny tells the truth, his trauma, guilt, depression, anxiety and Basil's... just magically disappear. Bad there, depression and anxiety is very difficult to cure and is even incurable in some cases, I don't know what to say about Sunny's but Basil's? bruh... and I feel that the confession of the truth was counter-prudent because since everyone now knows what Sunny and Basil did... well, Sunny will move on but Basil is going to be left suffering Bullying assuming that they did not forgive them (which is the most acurrate) so Sunny would be abandoning Basil again lol.   \n\n‚Ä¢Gameplay: well well, we come to the gameplay, I think I won't say much here because there isn't much to address. What complaints do I have with the gameplay? Well, more than Gameplay, it is more the design of the game. Let's start with Headspace, Sunny's place of escapism, well... headspace is an excessive injection of cringe, it's too childish, and it would be fine if this were a children's video game, but Omori is a game with serious themes, it is a game intended to teenagers and young adults, I don't think anyone here would tell me that they enjoyed how they wasted time in that dream world that was supposed to amaze me; Being a world of escapism, I'm supposed to prefer this place, right? that I don't want to leave or at least enjoy it more than real life, but when I started a section of Headspace I was just desperate for it to finish and go back to playing some section of the real world, and the fact that the parts of Headspace are more long that the real world is something that kills the game a lot, in headspace I don't feel like I'm advancing at all, obviously I don't advance in the plot because it's a world of escapism, but I don't feel like I'm advancing in headspace either, I mean... I kill enemies, I watch Sweetheart's whims, I watch Mr. Jawsum's scams or whatever that shark's name is, I don't feel like I'm progressing at all, *ahhhh but this doesn't matter, right? because everything in headspace is a very very very very very realistic symbolism of I don't know what in real life and since it is like that then it is a such big great masterpiece because the symbolism matters more than making a good game and I don't know what and mememememe*\n\n Omocat had the freedom to do some crazy and fun adventure, something that was interesting and even memorable, but no... headspace literally makes you sleepy (and not kidding, literally, even with the music) although well this can be forgiven, right? Because since it is a lucid world of dreams, then it must make me want to sleep, right? *bada dum tss*   \n\nAnyway, Omori left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and not because of its story trying to be tragic, but because of giving me an experience that I will not want to re-play, it is a game, but not a good game, it is a story, but not a good story.\n   \nThe only things I really liked were the music (the piano and violin, the rest seem meh) and the artistic style, I thought it was cute   \n\nAnd as I already told you, you could have just ignored everything I said and just given me a downvote because I'm just a stupid hater who doesn't understand the *very very very very deep psychology of Omori and is not able to understand his very very very very elaborate realistic story and that's why Omori is the game of the year and I don't know what* (ok ok sorry, but I had to vent somehow). \n  \nIf you want a psychologic horror game that is *actually* scary and has a better executed moral of forgiving yourself, and that above all is fun to play, I recommend trying Silent Hill 2.   \n\nI hope in the next manga that they are going to launch, they correct the narrative and plot errors, it would be a bit dull if they only traced the story, wouldn't it?   \n\nhaha anyway, have a good day my dear gringos, take care of your towers ",

Particularly things like emotional detachment, self-loathing, guilt and trauma were handled in an exceptionally good way that resonated with me and my own experiences. Since I consider those to be the game's strong points I could see how it would feel shallow to someone who can't connect to them, though I believe your criticism would be more coherent and perceived less as \"hate\" if there was less insulting sarcasm involved. \n\nBTW, re: truth about Mari's death - imho the game very much hints that Sunny's parents knew. You can meet his dad in black space, telling Sunny \"you're not my son\", while his mum says \"you're my son, I can't lose you too\". They seemed to be in disagreement, but if his mum wanted to keep the truth hidden in order to protect Sunny, it very much explains how a messy coverup like that stayed hidden to people outside of the family and Basil as an eyewitness. As to why he (Basil) and Sunny did it in the first place? I've heard and seen people do a lot of dumb shit when they are in shock or scared/panicking. It's really not that far fetched to not think straight after a traumatising experience like that. \n\nThe point I do agree with, however, is that it's not an overall masterpiece if you look at it objectively. My personal pet peeve is the RPG elements in headspace and the overall combat system. It just wasn't that fun to me. Which isn't surprising, considering it's the team's very first project and omocat's very first game/RPG.",

        "body": "I feel like there's a pretty large gap, especially in a pixel art game, between \"a big dramatic trauma response\" and \"literally nothing.\" Sunny freezing up, his expression changing, his body tensing, and even stuff like going into a dissociative episode aren't things we really *could* see as the player, since the art style of the game is fairly limited. When I played the game I didn't assume he had *no* reaction to all those things since it made sense that he would, so I just filled in the gaps with my imagination. I didn't feel like I *needed* Sunny's sprite to have a visible reaction.\n\nI also think that, outside of Headspace and some moments where Sunny's fears kind of spill over into reality (like when he jumps into the lake or tries to go down the stairs), the game is pretty subtle about how it handles trauma. Headspace is very vivid and *literal*, and especially places like Black Space really lay his psychology bare, but real human Sunny isn't a very dramatic kid. The way he handles his grief and guilt isn't over the top, imo, since for the most part he just goes quiet and numb. It takes until the very end of the game for him to actually let go and cry, because he's been in a half dissociative state for four years.\n\nI think there's also a pragmatic writing issue here ‚Äî if the game makes it *too* obvious what the truth is then more players will guess twists like \"Mari's dead\" and \"Sunny killed her\" ahead of time, so a lot of early scenes (like fear of heights) have a level of plausible deniability built in. I think the fact that you *can* read it as being entirely about heights rather than Mari is intentional, since it facilitates the mystery.  \nBut then on the other hand, Headspace balances out the scales. After he pushes past his fear of heights we don't get any more dark/trippy visuals around the stairs in Sunny's house, but *so* many times something scary happens in Headspace it's accompanied by the repeated visual of stairs, so it's clear he's at least subconsciously fixated on them.\n\nSo... idk! I see what you mean I guess, but it works for me. When I played the game I *definitely* felt like Sunny was haunted by his trauma.",

Even thinking back to my own life, there are somethings I pretend didn't exist and never happened, thinking about them makes me sad or angry, but to me most of the time they never happened. Of course no where near the level of accidentally killing my own sibling, moreso petty embarrassments caused by a dumber younger version of myself.\n\nSunny is excellently written and one of my favorite characters ever made, its just the people in this fandom glamorizing all this stuff tricking you into believing that hes supposed to react violently or something when in reality hes reacting as any normal person would.",

        "body": "I would argue there‚Äôs a lot more hidden trauma reactions.\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the stairs. One of the things OMORI does very well is ‚Äúludonarrative assonance‚Äù. The stairs are _instantly_ established as a source of fear to the player. Sunny himself doesn‚Äôt have to show any response to the stairs afterwards; the game is designed such that you, the player, remember the stair sequence. The whole house is ‚Äúserene‚Äù, but it‚Äôs also hauntingly empty. You _have_ to climb the stairs to start and end the real world segments, and the emotions you‚Äôre feeling at that point in the story influence how much dread you, the player, feel doing that.       \nIn addition, when the arachnophobia is addressed, there‚Äôs a very large puddle of spiders at the feet of the stairs that squish unpleasantly when you step over them. The spider at the top of the stairs is the arachnophobia bossfight, too. The only day the stairs aren‚Äôt addressed is when Hero comes back and you have the sleepover with him and Kel, which can be explained as the friends making Sunny feel safe.\n\nI‚Äôd argue Sunny is traumatised the moment Aubrey mentions Mari‚Äôs death. The church turns red, and he willingly fist-fights Aubrey in the middle of it. The music here also has a dissociative quality to it. Later on, you the player choose how badly Sunny‚Äôs affected: does he have the strength to raise his hand for Kel to high-five it? Or is Sunny still nonverbal and dissociating?",

        "body": "I think it‚Äôs worth pointing out that all the examples you‚Äôve pointed out take place in Faraway Town - or in other words, real life. And in that realm Sunny is very consistent in the fact that he expresses virtually no emotion at all. Even in the group hug cutscene by the tree stump, Sunny looks slightly surprised, but that‚Äôs it. And perhaps most telling, when fighting, Sunny literally can‚Äôt be affected by emotion. He always stays neutral.\n\nContrast this with Headspace. Everything is fantastical, hyper-colorful, and charged. Yes, Sunny is ‚Äúcliff-faced‚Äù here too (as Omori) but in battle he can express emotion - now in sometimes terrifyingly exaggerated fashion. \n\nSo maybe it‚Äôs interesting to consider that while Headspace in some sense was created by Sunny to suppress his memories, it was likewise created as a realm in which he could express emotions that he had lost in real life. But because it‚Äôs an illusion and not carried out in a healthy way, the emotions are distorted and stretched.\n\nAnd to that point, your observation that Sunny finally reacts strongly with emotion when Basil brings up Something makes sense: by explicitly crossing over real life with Headspace, Sunny is forced to confront the two at once and almost has a nervous break down at the prospect. And I think it‚Äôs also significant that after defeating Omori and waking up, the first thing Sunny does is cry. After four years of virtually no emotion in real life, it all comes flooding back to him (or at least enough to really begin healing).\n\nThose are my thoughts! Otherwise I also agree with comments pointing out things like the pixel art style during gameplay limiting subtle visual cues - which I actually like because, as this post demonstrates, it makes the player increasingly uncomfortable with Sunny‚Äôs seeming lack of emotional reaction and connection to anything. And slowly the player doubts, the more they play the game, whether Sunny actually *is* capable of feeling anything at all, which in turn makes the reveal even more scary as one considers that perhaps there is some latent kind of malicious evil in Sunny, and subsequently the true ending is even more cathartic as one realizes during the Final Duet that Sunny truly loved Mari and everyone else deeply and fully this whole time - it just took so much effort to bring all those feelings back into real life again.",

    "selftext": "Disclaimer, I've not **played** this game. Been watching someone play it and she finished it tonight. But I paid attention to it, for the most part. And while I was a bit confused how the real world and head space were connected, what purpose Sweetheart and Space Boyfriend and Pluto and the sprout moles served, I was fine with it because the writing is charming. I thought all of this would build up to something. And if it didn't, then oh well, I liked how this was a bittersweet story about growing apart from your friends, moving away from them, and hanging on to those memories. Mari's death, in that context, was a sad event in the background that brought the group closer together.\n\nAnd yet, as anyone on this sub would know, that's not really... the point of the game. Instead we get this shock value twist that is barely hinted at throughout the game. This is where I'm thinking maaaaaybe my experience as viewer as opposed to player factors into this. It's possible if I'd have played it, there would be foreshadowing I'd pick up. But I feel like if you're going to do a twist like this, there needs to be an element of \"Oh shit, THAT'S what that means???\" instead of making me feel like \"Where did this even COME from?\"\n\nThere's that, but then also how Omori overcame his fears in head space... I don't understand what that's ultimately supposed to represent. I suppose fear of heights relates to pushing Mari down the stairs, but what about the others? \n\nJust I dunno, this game feels like three or four separate ideas that don't mesh together in any cohesive or thematic way. Each different story is fine, but what do they have to do with one another?",

Heavy Spoilers\n\nHeadspace is Sunny's escape from the guilt he carries from Mari's death, and it's intentional that its story never amounts to anything because its only purpose is to distract Sunny and protect him from the truth. It's why the black lightbulb is the \"repression of an idea,\" and the lightbulb is gone in Black Space. The real story of Headspace is finding the Keys which lead you to Black Space and the truth that Omori is trying to keep buried to protect Sunny.\n\nI don't know how much you saw or didn't see but there's a nuts amount of foreshadowing to the truth if you know where to look for it as the truth seeps into Headspace and gets more apparent as you go on. The forest area has a tree with a tire hanging like a noose with something inside it, the Wise Rock advice, Mari's appearance, and dialogue before arriving in Deep Well, the cutscenes and hangman game with the keys, every line in Deeper Well pretty much. They refer to Omori as a dreamer and talk gibberish to any party member but him. The Lost Library tells you events that happened in the real world such as Sunny almost drowning. etc. Even things like Mari at night appearing nightmarish in the mirror and the door gives clues that Sunny's being haunted by her memory, and god damn near everything in Black Space. In particular the scene where Something follows Omori and says I love you, as that was my Wtf where did this come from moment and then it all clicked.\n\nIn my own experience learning the truth about Mari's death was that incredible Holy Shit moment because the Black Space photo gallery lets you slowly piece it together, along with the fight with Something that slowly turns into a girl hanging, and the cutscene where it zooms into a picture of Mari hanging where she looks up and turns into Something.\n\nSunny's fears in headspace are all related to Mari, and specifically her saving him from drowning which is brought up in the Lost Library and the Final Duet off of the top of my head. Heights relate to both the stairs and the pillar he fell off of, and he fell off into the lake because of a Spider and thought he was going to drown until Mari saved him. Sunny overcoming his fears to me represent him overcoming the truth. Something is the truth about Mari and all three of these fears are explicitly titled as a variation of Something. Him overcoming these in addition to mending the violin and facing Omori is what allows him to tell his friends the truth in the hospital.\n\nSorry for Essay",

This game has numerous problems with its plot (Like how Headspace has literary almost zero relevance to the plot) and its plot twist (how in the goddamn world did the boys get away with Mari's death?) but the problems usually stem from either not explaining in detail the events (the Truth) or straight up ignoring obvious inconsistencies (The four year gap between death of Mari to the game's start is an obvious example). All of these are definitely problems that become more and more obvious with each subsequent playthrough but I don't say it is a problem of messy writing, it is just bad writing in some section or just wasting potential of fleshing out the characters more.\n\nYou criticism with twist is understandable even though like others have mentioned there are quite a bit of things hinting at the twist (doesn't excuses the shittier qualities of the twist, but this is not a twist like you said that comes out right out of the open with no context).\n\nI don't understand what you are saying about the fears in headspace.

Most of the characters are likeable and unlikable but I just am beginning to hate some of the character like basil and omori. Also the combat is extremely boring as it just begins to repeat itself, and the visuals and music don't cut it as I can just watch a video with the music and artwork. I have gone through trauma and it is pretty accurate at times but it just begins to frustrate me how easy things can be fixed with a conversation but just be dragged on for the entire game, like the situation with Aubrey. I'm halfway through the game so I'm not sure what to do- do I still play or stop",

I mean i love them, genuinely, but the game doesn't give them any depth. Also in the community the only way people portray Kel and Hero are from these two lines of dialogue in the game in wich Kel tells us that Hero lashed out on him that one time...\nSo yeah maybe it's just me but the thing is that I love to analyze characters ! I think Basil, Sunny and Aubrey are good written characters with a lot of nuances and that what makes them humans. \n\nAnyways let me know what you think about this and again, don't get me wrong, I really like Hero and Kel, I just don't see the depth in them in contrast of the other friends from the main cast.\n\n(Also english isn't my main language so sorry if I made any mistakes!)",

    "selftext": "I have always wondered, why almost 90% of OMORI‚Äôs fandom is exclusively dedicated to the RW main cast. In the community every day most of the appreciation and fanart posts are about sunny, omori, kel, aubrey, hero, basil or/and mari, maybe also a little bit of sweetheart sometimes.\n\nWhen people ask or their favorite character is, the Headspace characters or even the secondary faraway town characters are almost never taken into account, they might be well liked but almost everyone‚Äòs ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù will always be part of the main six. I know that these six are the most developed and important characters that have the most roles in the story, but there‚Äôs a notable lack of content for the Headspace characters. I know they are not as ‚Äúimportant‚Äù as the main six, but they are all pretty unique and likable.\n\nPluto, Space Ex-Boyfriend, Unbread Twins, Slime Girls, Jawsum, Humphrey, just to name a few, Basil seem to have more fanart and content than all of them combined. While they might be well-liked, they are mostly forgotten when it comes to fanart, memes, kinnie bingos, ships, etc, they do also have these, just extremely sparse and little compared to the main six. Sweetheart seems to be the only major HS character that has a consistent amount of discussion and fanart, but even then, it‚Äôs still very far from the main cast members.\n\nWhy is it like that? I know they have reasons to be more popular than the rest, but most of the front part of the fandom seems to know nobody but these six characters.",

    "selftext": "This post will be dedicated to debunking and/or countering common points of the \"canonicity\" of Sunburn.\n\n\"Basil said Sunny blushes when looking at Aubrey!!\"\n\n1) This is from an outside perspective. Sunny's sprite is not shown to change to reflect any sort of blushing.\n\n2) It's *Basil* who says this. Sunny blushing around Basil matches with some evidence in the game that supports a certain homosexual boy pairing. Basil also is very self-doubting and depressed, meaning he would not really think to associate Sunny blushing, as mentioned, with Sunny having the possibility of like-liking him.\n\n\"Omori and Aubrey are in a relationship-thing in headspace\"\n\n1)Despite what you may think, I am not going to claim Omori is not dating Aubrey, though it is very very unclear and confusing. Omori is designed to keep Sunny from asking any self-reflective questions to keep him from the truth. Questioning his sexuality is pretty self-reflective. How would you keep him from questioning it? Give him a girlfriend.\n\n2) Also Omori shows any genuine affection or love towards Aubrey all of 0 times. Significantly less than with Basil, though this could be hand-waved by saying they aren't *reeeally* dating in headspace, so that is not that big of a point.\n\n\"The Blackspace dream sequence!\"\n\nHonestly seemed like it was trying to show that Omori thought of (HS) Aubrey as nothing more than a disposable tool. Replaceable and large in numbers. Not to mention the weird vibes reminding me of a sort of nightmare you'd have when you're 7.\n\n\"The love note!!!\"\n\nWhile the existence of this supposed love note may not even be real, there is also a sort of deep dive in on what the love note was, and also reflects on another reason Omori dates Aubrey: to make Aubrey \"happy\" (even as just a figment of his imagination). https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/n18mtb/spoilers_a_crackpot_theory_about_the_love_letter/\n\n\"On the swings..!\"\n\nThe conversation on the swings implies nothing directly. The best you can go off of is her facial expressions. Plus Sunny be swinging üòé.\n\n\"Yeah well, it's more supported than Sunflower!!\"\n\nYes I'm biased, time to explain some supporting evidence for Sunflower:\n\n1) Bossrush. Just look at them. Gay fucks.\n\n2) Basil's photo album in the real world reveals he only wore the flower crown once in real life, doubting himself, as he is known to do. As we see in Headspace, Sunny had a strong opinion on how Basil looked with the flower crown.\n\n3) Gay facial structure\n\n4) Sunny subconsciously places Basil on a similar pedestal as Mari, depicting him as perfect in his mind. Of course, as he was directly involved with the truth, Omori probably has a significantly less positive opinion on him.\n\n5) Stranger, being a silhouette of Basil, is the antithesis to Omori. Being a good in Sunny's mind to counteract an evil. Gay.\n\n6) Constantly holding hands, similar to something I would do, and I am gay, soooooo....\n\n7) also I am omocat and I made it canon I said so\n\n8) oh and Basil covered up a fucking murder for his \"bestie\" so that's kinda gay to say the least.\n\nThanks for reading, if you have any counterarguments (countercounterarguments?) to this post, feel free to comment below. Unless it is arguing with my 7th point, which is true and factual.",

Despite all the things you said, there is nothing in the same to really suggest Sunny wouldn't have a crush on Aubrey. And the Aubrey side of the equation is fairly well evident. Also, the conversation in memory lane DOES point towards SunBurn, despite any deflection you might suggest.\n\nI am a huge fan of Sunflower, but that ship is also not \"canon\". It does have a lot of supporting evidence in how intense Sunny and Basil can get regarding each other. Their relationship has a lot of romantic connotation and I also think they are both very gay.\n\nLet people enjoy their ships is my point.",

Like no ones invalidating anything, this is literally discussing the canonicity of certain ships and evidence they hold. (Tho I don't see this sort of reaction pop up when sunburn fans do it) \n\nTho I'd say most of your points are OK \n\n>Basil said Sunny blushes when looking at Aubrey!!\"\n\n\nPretty sure sunny did actually blush, now whether or not it was directed specifically at Aubrey, that's up for interpretation tho it seems like its the most reasonable conclusion. I think he used to have a crush on her at some point, but as he got closer to Basil his heart started pulling more in his direction.\n\n>Also Omori shows any genuine affection or love towards Aubrey all of 0 times.\n\nVery true, Omori is incredible cold and standoffish of Aubrey hs a bit, the only thing he really gives her is a high five. Now contract that to just how close and intimate Omori gets with Basil. The tag thats specifically Omoris tag to Basil is a handhold, I think it shows who he really wants to be intimate with. \n\n>The conversation on the swings implies nothing directly. \n\nYep I always saw it as just a friendly thing of her going \"hey take care of yourself\" I think even Kel has said more romantic stuff to Sunny in that time. \n\n> time to explain some supporting evidence for Sunflower\n\nFunny thing is you like barely scratched the surface of evidence and subtext sunflower has. Didn't mention the coral branch, didn't mention Basil explaining the White Tulip, didn't explain all the art of Sunny in the group, near Basil with a flower also in his hair and there's still so much more I didn't mention.",

Omori is designed to keep Sunny from asking any self-reflective questions to keep him from the truth. Questioning his sexuality is pretty self-reflective. How would you keep him from questioning it? Give him a girlfriend.\n\nI have no idea who told you that, but i think they mean sunny/omori is the one imagining aubrey crushing on him, omori is sunny his not a separate entity there huge drama because of this. I dont think sexuality is the point the game lad its really cool headcanons you know, but i dont think its really part of the story\n\n\n>Also Omori shows any genuine affection or love towards Aubrey all of 0 times.

The best you can go off of is her facial expressions. Plus Sunny be swinging üòé.\n\nThey are about four scenes of them in the swings, but the one that standout is the final duet scene. Its the only scene where is sunny is alone with someone rather than mari, which implies he adored his bond with aubrey(its in the tumblr post too)\n\nFor your sunflower points theres some point doesnt makes \n\n\n>Stranger, being a silhouette of Basil, is the antithesis to Omori. Being a good in Sunny's mind to counteract an evil. Gay.\n\nStranger is sunny subconscious and extension of himself, stranger takes different forms not only basil but probably because the reason cause of this because his related to what \"happened\"\n\n\n>Gay facial structure\n\nAll of them have pretty much have the same facial structure because omocat has what's called \"same face syndrome\" but hey i would deny that\n\n>Constantly holding hands, similar to something I would do, and I am gay, soooooo....\nI dont think thats a good argument because basil and aubrey did to. I think its just shows how they are close to each other \n\n\n>oh and Basil covered up a fucking murder for his \"bestie\" so that's kinda gay to say the least.\n\nU know u can like your pair thats fine, but i dont think hanging a dead body and cover up a crime is romantic at all...\n\n\nIn conclusion\nShips/pairs are just funny hc that everyone can enjoy no matter what it is, its supposed to be some u can cope with \nSunburn,suntan, sunflower, photobomb,kelbrey, and cactiflower are all cool so have a great day",

    "selftext": "I bought Omori around August 2024 and I recently finished it a few days ago. One of my friends bought the game around the same time I did but he finished it around mid September.\n\nI was very bored while playing this game, most of the game was just a walking simulator with a similar copy to undertales enemy system. \nOther gameplay mechanics like battles, bosses and some puzzles felt a bit boring to me also. Especially battles, I found them to be basically the same thing as undertale battles except without the fun parts. The only positive thing I can think about the battles would be how you have four characters to attack and strategising how to use them. \n\nThe story was ok I guess. People on this sub talk about how it was sad and stuff but I didn‚Äôt really find that emotional connection with the games story or characters. Going through blackspace was interesting I have to admit. But overall I really didn‚Äôt think this was anything special, I was very bored going through it causing me to take long breaks in between game sessions so maybe due to the big breaks I forgot some things that may have impacted my opinion.\n\nMy friend on the other hand absolutely adores this game to the fullest. I don‚Äôt blame him though he probably just sees things differently to how I did. \n\nI don‚Äôt really know where I was going with this post I was just bored i guess. Feel free to let me know if i should try to do a different ending or something next time but idk if I‚Äôll play the game again.\n\n(Please remember this is in all my opinion)",

    "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n***(WARNING!: SPOILERS! ALSO THIS IS MY OPINION AND INTERPATION OF THIS GAME. I AM NOT ATTACKING YOU OR YOUR LIKING OF THIS GAME!!! I DO NOT MEAN TO CAUSE PROBLEMS, MERELY PRESENT MY PERSPECTIVE!!!!)***\n\nThis review has been four years in the making\n\nIn the history of the world, no game has ever been more glazed than the \"psychological\" \"RPG\" and \"HORROR\" \"GAME\" of Omori. Short for \"Hikkomori\" this supposed game was released in 2020 after over 7 years of development. That's strike one. This \"game\" is a shallow hollow-less husk clone of Earthbound, and just as mid as that game too.\n\nNow, let me give you a small plot summary of this product (spoilers, of course :D)  \n\n\nSunny, the protagonist accidentally pushed his sister, Mari, down the stairs because of an upcoming duet Sunny was not ready for. His best friend, Basil, was there but did not witness the incident, and offered the idea to frame her death as a suicide. After her funeral, all of the friends disband and went down their own path. Sunny, due to the overbearing trauma and misery, forcefully forget about the truth of Mari's death by his hand. Eventually, all his memories turned into dreams. Omori, the personification of Sunny's trauma and repression, became responsible for protecting his mind from the horrors of the truth. Sunny would spend all his time indoors, eating, using the bathroom, and sleeping. After 4 years, one of his other closest friends, Kel, disturbs this endless cycle. Sunny begins his path of uncovering the truth and forgiving himself for what he has done from here.\n\nNow look, ive watched flawed storylines before, such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, 3, New Vegas, Far Cry 6, and some more. But in those games, I was at least invested within ***some*** of the characters and storylines even if the overall story was mid or below. Even then, some lines and moments within those rather weak or underwhelming stories were very well made and generally gave me emotions and impacted me.\n\nHowever, in Omori... I have ***NEVER*** cared so little about a group of characters. Sunny (our main protagonist) is a shallow pathetically written character that has no development at all throughout the entire story. Basil is a whiny, annoying character that makes my teeth grind when he dare appear on my damn screen. Aubrey is a woman. Kel is... okay. Hero is a half-baked, meek, and horrifically written character. He is the very reason why Ive always hated characters like him ever since ive touched this game. Mari is also underbaked and badly written. She is also dead for like half the story.\n\nThe story is a complete slog to go through, you spend so much time dicking around in headspace that the Real life sections (which are like 3-4 hours max of content, most of which consists of meaningless yap) and these lines, **OH MY GOODNESSSSS!** they suck!\n\nThe final stretch of this story is mid, no.. not just mid. STINKY. these parts made me want to end it all. Basically, its revealed that you killed your sister by pushing down the stairs on accident and whatever and then you yap. BORING AND MID!!!!!!! I have never in my life been so confused about a \"plot twist\" in a game.\n\nNow, I got the \"good ending\" the first time.. and ill admit. the Final duet, that... made me cry...\n\nBesides that, everything else about was trash.\n\nNow **for Gameplay**\n\nOmori is an RPG maker game so the main gameplay of Omori consists of earthbound, top down, pixel, RPG elements with party elements blended in together. sound interesting right? well...\n\nThe gameplay, is trash to me. Look, i play mostly shooters and first-person RPGs and I grew up with those types of games so what I will say will mostly like come from my personal biases and my interests that have been molded by what games I grew up with. But, I have played games outside my comfort zone before, like coffee talk, and Animal Crossing (mostly cause a girl I had a crush on played it) and I enjoyed those games.\n\nOmori is outside my comfort zone area thing and I dislike it. The gameplay is repetitive and disgustingly simple. You enter combat, use skill moves, and win or lose. Horry! awful. now a review I watched back when the game came out in 2020 said \"If you like Pokemon you will most likely love Omori\" and I love Pokemon so I thought \"Oh! this game will be awesome!\" NOPE! The gameplay just sucks and it feels dull and not rewarding. Ive always hated it. Now, I do admit I like the item, weapons, and toys system. and some of the combat was aight.\n\nNow onto the \"philosophy\" part of this game... it's trash. Now, due to my previous section, you may be thinking \"Oh... he doesn't like RPG maker games so he probably doesn't like philosophical stuff right?\" somewhat, I don't really like **LIKE** philosophical games and media but i do like my good amount of it. I watch Evangelion, Lain, and Hello Kitty which are pretty philosophical stuff and I liked them. Mostly Evangelion cause of the robot fights but Lain was good too.\n\nBut the \"philosophy\" content of omori is... just trash. Just AWFUL! Its the most cookie-cutter \"depression bad\" stuff ever! And some \"dont hide your emotions and feelings through a mask!\" crap. Both are valid points but dear goodness I get it man! every single piece of content with \"philosophy\" thrown in has those same themes. Even the previously mentioned Evangelion and Lain. But they do it in a more creative and better-written way than Omori does.\n\nThis is celeste level stuff man.\n\nNow to my final point for this review, the music is all aight. Now my cup of tea, but it's okay. Final Duet, good morning, and Remembrance are my favorite tracks.\n\n***CONCLUSION***\n\nWe are in the zenith of the Human age, Omori stands as a shining example of the disaster to come. it's a shallow, pathetic, flaccid, and miserable experience that has been praised like it's some \"masterpiece\". If you enjoy this game, That's okay. I just mildly dislike this game.\n\n**For every Omori fan, I want you to tell me your points and why I'm wrong. I really really want to like this game and enjoy it fully. Open my eyes to what I was wrong about, I could be wrong on all of my points about the gameplay, writing, story, characters, and philosophy of OMORI. Please give me your opinions**\n\nOmori gets my official rating of 3/10.",

No? I didnt think so. I get headspace, but alot of the game is the real world and that is not earthbound.\n\n\"Sunny has no development at all thoughout the game\" ok i want to say this in the least aggressive way posible. Are you stupid? You sound stupid right now. In the begining he is a depressed kid and at the end he accepcts what he did and even smiles for the first time in the entire game. You just played this entire game with the thought that it was a rip-off that thats all you could think about meaning you never understood it.\n\n\"Aubrey is a woman\" That is sexist. Your entire point is invalid and nothing you can say will fix it.\n\n\"Mari is also dead the entire story\" Thats the point. It makes the twist hit harder.\n\n\"Real life is boring\" Yes. real life is boring. Thats the point.\n\n\"The plot twist is boring and stinky\" You are not a person who can enjoy this game then. This is not the type of game for you. You simply dont have the ability to fully understand it. Thats fine, but others can. Its kinda dumb to say somthing is stupid when you cant even understand it.\n\n\"The gameplay sucks. Its an RPG.\" Yes its an rpg what did you expect. You are a person who plays firstperson shooters all the time dont expect to enjoy an RPG. You are not a person who can enjoy this genera so dont cry about the game sucking if you cant even enjoy it no matter what they do. Im sorry RPGS dont have segments where it turns into a first person war sim.\n\n\"the gamplay is repetetive\" thats an rpg. what did you expect. A first person gun fight? its an rpg.\n\n\"I like pokemon\" How? You dont like repetetive crap pokemon is \"Oh they are a fire type time to go water oh wow i win.\" To be fair i dont play pokemon so i could be wrong here and if i am my mistake.\n\n\"Hide your feelings behind a mask crap\" They are kids! Kids hide stuff when they do bad things! They KILLED a person for christ sake they are going to hide it they dont want to go to jail! And you could say \"Oh it was an acident they wont go to jail\" They dont know that! Theyre kids!\n\n\"This is some celeste level stuff man\" I dont belive you could make a valid point that celeste sucks if this is what your making.\n\n\"Omori stands as the disaster to come\" Overwatch 2 is the disaster to come $20 bucks for a single hero in a game with over 25 or so heros for fucks sake the cereal box costs more in game than it does in real life.\n\n\"i just midly dislike this game.\" Are you sure? you seem to hate it like its the bully that puched you every day back at school.\n\n\"I want your opinion on why i was wrong\" At least you are aware your not perfect. Points for that.",

I'm sorry, but what? \n\n...The main cast, to most, is just overall nice. Hard to \"prove\" much here, despite a few other inconsistencies or problems regarding any of them. Some of them have a bit of depth in a few places.\n\nThe story didn't seem to be outright terrible, with the main issues generally being about the length of DW, but also just the plot twist. The latter... well, i don't really have any issues with that, despite dislike towards the whole self-forgiveness thing... Whatever, so, the issues here can either be tolerated or not. Most people here tolerated them.\n\nGameplay... it's turn-based, dunno what to tell you. Obviously the length of the playthrough can tire you out, but other than that and the fact that you can brute force basically everything... it works. The emotion mechanic is neat to most, and the abilities work.\n\nI used to, and still play shooters. Didn't stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nMetaphors... I admit, i also had a problem with them, mostly just the ones related to, again, forgiveness (do note, i'm the only one of that type here, so i assume that what others say will be different). Everything else... you can either sumarise them with the simplest description, or add a bit more meat to it. Or just make up your own that fits the context in-game, i dunno.\n\n...\nThere's plenty left out here, but... i think this works.\n\nOh, and regarding the other media you use... I know that Far Cry New Dawn was utter garbage (because i bought it, duh), and 6 doesn't seem too different. Not exactly monuments of plot here. \n\nHaven't heard of much else, aside from Evangelion's \"barricade the patient room before **he** gets here\", or... was that not it? Hmh.\n\n(P.S: Whatever somebody else says or tries to affect you with, there's a pretty good chance that it won't do anything. I don't exactly know if you want to be swayed off of your current perspective, but as implied, you are maybe stuck with it.)",

        "body": "From what i'm reading here, it seems like this is just not your kind of game. I'm going to do my best to avoid seething over you calling the characters shallow when i've spent paragraphs and paragraphs discussing their intricacies, lol.\n\n>This \"game\" is a shallow hollow-less husk clone of Earthbound, and just as mid as that game too.\n\nIt'd be nice if you could back this up, personally i don't think that having a somewhat similar tone and gameplay system makes it a clone.\n\n>Sunny (our main protagonist) is a shallow pathetically written character  that has no development at all throughout the entire story.\n\nIf you think Sunny is shallow, you probably aren't looking at the story the right way. Everything in Headspace comes straight from Sunny's mind, and the majority of narration is from Sunny's perspective. Segments like the Lost Library and Black Space directly show us how Sunny sees himself and his friends.\n\n>The story is a complete slog to go  through, you spend so much time dicking around in headspace that the Real life sections (which are like 3-4 hours max of content, most of  which consists of meaningless yap) and these lines, **OH MY GOODNESSSSS!** they suck!  \n>  \n>The  final stretch of this story is mid, no.. not just mid. STINKY. these  parts made me want to end it all. Basically, its revealed that you  killed your sister by pushing down the stairs on accident and whatever  and then you yap. BORING AND MID!!!!!!! I have never in my life been so  confused about a \"plot twist\" in a game.\n\nThis part of the review reads like a temper tantrum... Why do the lines \"suck\"? You just don't like the writing style, or is it just because it's not focused on progressing the main plot?\n\nIt's totally understandable to get tired of how little Headspace actually progresses the plot. Personally i just enjoy exploring Headspace because of the beautiful art, decent combat, and i just find the silly characters fun. It feels a bit like filler content, but it's also sort of supposed to.\n\nAlso, I do sort of get what you mean about the plot twist being confusing. The photo segment can be hard to understand since it's presented out of order for some reason. I didn't really get it my first time playing. I was lucky that i had someone else with me who got the message better.\n\n>Omori is outside my comfort zone area thing and I dislike it. The  gameplay is repetitive and disgustingly simple. You enter combat, use  skill moves, and win or lose. Horry! awful.\n\nPersonally, i think the combat system is unique enough to be fun for about one playthrough. There are plenty of strategies you CAN use, you can mix up your skills and use different emotions, follow-up attacks level up throughout the game, but at the end of the day it is still RPGmaker turn-based combat. There's only so much depth you can have, and usually there is one dominant strategy that works for everything. Ultimately it's up to the player to figure out the way they prefer to play, and that doesn't always result in a fun experience.\n\n>But the \"philosophy\" content of omori is... just trash. Just AWFUL! Its  the most cookie-cutter \"depression bad\" stuff ever! And some \"dont hide  your emotions and feelings through a mask!\" crap.\n\nI can't say i agree. OMORI is about depression, but it's also about guilt and the effects that it has on a person. It's about all the different ways that people react to the grief of losing a loved one. Sure, they're not completely unique ideas, but it executes these ideas in its own unique way. OMORI is special to me because of the slower moments, like looking at their memories in the scrapbook, or reading about their history together in the Lost Library, or even just Sunny staring in the mirror at 2am. It makes me feel like i can relate to and care about the characters.\n\n>We are in the zenith of the Human age, Omori stands as a shining example  of the disaster to come. it's a shallow, pathetic, flaccid, and  miserable experience that has been praised like it's some \"masterpiece\".  If you enjoy this game, That's okay. I just mildly dislike this game.\n\nif you \"just mildly dislike\" it then why go on a rant about it like that??????!!",

It‚Äôs really not cookie cutter seeing what they did with this story 3-Aubrey being a woman shouldn‚Äôt affect you 4-Sunny did go through a lot of character development. He started shy, closed in, a hikkiomori (a person who doesn‚Äôt leave the house).

They‚Äôre going to have similar elements. 6-The reason Mari is dead the whole story is to express the fact of Sunny‚Äôs guilt. Without Mari being dead. How would his world have evolved to what it is today? How would we of known about his trauma? It really wouldn‚Äôt of had the same affect if it happened in story, right? Coming back to the DW after learning mari‚Äôs dead was how it showed everyone the sadness of this kid. Learning how Mari died showed how everyone grew over the years being affected by this. 7-The plot twist may be boring to you, but it‚Äôs the part that makes the game stand out above the rest. This is something you would of never seen coming, as someone who saw spoilers this is still surprising to this day. 8-The real world is supposed to be how the real world is. For this kid, it‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs supposed to get you to want to return to the dream world out of comfort. Look. You can hate the game but that doesn‚Äôt give you the exact right to nitpick it for every teensy tiny little mistake. sure it has its flaws but there‚Äôs reasons this game came to be how well known it is. ¬†Omori isint a disaster.

I don't understand why, but it's fine. But if you want to argue about the topic you should try doing so respectfully. Insulting the game for no good reason is really unnecessary. You're saying it's fine if we like the game and that you only mildly dislike it, yet you continue to insult the game over and over as if it was the worst piece of media you have ever consumed. Also, Sunny has no character development? Are you sure? You do know what this game is about right? Yes, the battle system is somewhat repetitive, but that is the nature of turn based rpgs. If you don't like it, don't play it, but don't complain about it, since it's not something objectively bad, but rather just your opinion. You can argue why you don't like turn based rpgs, but if you critique a game using this is not a good point. I like the combat, in this game and in every other turn based rpg I have played. Also, you really dislike the music? I really don't understand that but that's fine. Once again, I'd like to mention how invested I was in this game emotionally (like most people are). I know this game has multiple endings/routs, but after playing it for the first time I could not bring myself to go for anything else. I got the good ending and I really didn't want to put the characters through the bad stuff, even if it is completely fictional. Of course I'm curious about it, but still. And I didn't really mind doing genocide in Undertale, if that's worth anything. This game might just be my favourite game.",

    "selftext": "I completed my first playthrough of Omori a couple days ago, got the good ending and have since looked at the other endings online because I was pretty burnt out on the game already (I'll definitely be picking it back up to 100% the achievements though). I liked it, thought it was interesting, but I honestly thought that the twist was underwhelming and undermined how heartbreaking the concept of suicide is. \n\nIt feels like the story used suicide as a creepy hook because it's so morbid, had this buildup of showing the grief and the friends wondering why Mari did it, only to then show that it was actually this weird accident where Sunny killed Mari when he was overwhelmed and emotional during an argument. I don't know how to explain it, but this just felt so lame to me. I guess it's because I thought this game would be EXPLORING suicide and its consequences, but instead it uses it as like a red herring to show you an even more \"disturbing\" chain of events. And this is what bothers me, because is suicide not disturbing and devastating enough? Did you really have to set up *suicide* as a peg down from another cause of death?\n\nWhile it is up to the storyteller to decide what story they want to tell, it's my personal opinion that there comes some responsibility in using certain morbid topics, especially when it comes to mental health. And I think this game fumbled it a little bit. I enjoyed Basil's extreme anxiety and overwhelming guilt, but as others have said, he does not get enough screen time. I enjoy the concept of Sunny having a dream world as a form of escapism, but even then, Headspace felt inconsequential to me.\n\nBasically, and I know it's ridiculous to say, I just wanted more from this story/I wanted the story to be different. I think it would have been a much more engaging/emotional experience for Mari's death to ACTUALLY be a suicide and have the entire cast reflect on their roles in her life. Maybe Headspace could have been a place for all of their consciences to go and the different areas could have been them exploring/learning different lessons. For example, Pyrefly Forest could have centered around Hero and his fear of spiders where he'd also learn/realize that there were moments he chose to remain ignorant of Mari's suffering because he didn't want to believe she was depressed. And then the final boss/ending would be them coming to terms with their actions while also realizing that it wasn't their responsibility to save Mari; her decision was her own.\n\nTL;DR I think Omori used suicide as a horror hook because it's scary, which I think was irresponsible/underwhelming/could have been used a different way. Suicide is devastating, not just scary or morbid, and the layers that come with it have way more potential for a story than the scary imagery of Mari hanging from a noose.",

It's present throughout the many bad endings, and looms over you from the very first time you use STAB to wake up. So it makes for an extremely effective red herring because it is positioned as a major theme of the game. By subverting this theme with Mari, you can later return to it at full impact with Sunny and Basil.\n\nThe other thing is that despite Mari not having actually committed suicide, the fact that everyone, including you think she did allows the game to explore the theme of suicide through the perspective of those left behind. If the suicide theme was left for Sunny and Basil, you couldn't properly explore the way someone offing themselves impacts those around them on the long term.  You get to see how Hero, Kel and Aubrey each dealt with Mari's supposed suicide, and how it affected their relationships.\n\nIn the end, Omori is a game about exploring emotions, relationships and trauma. I feel that this plot point was absolutely necessary to achieve everything the game intended to accomplish in these fields. That's all there is to it.",

        "body": "Disagree totally, mainly because suicide and it‚Äôs effects would be like the most stock emotional indie game theme to center your game on, and I was anticipating not liking this story for quite a while because of the suicide at the center of it. Just to be frank I think as a concept it‚Äôs pretty trite and even lame, whereas the actual route the game decides to go down has a level of visceral impact and personal implication that that kind of concept can‚Äôt approach. \n\nIt‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôm being dismissive of suicide as a serious topic, it obviously is, and many a good story has been written about it. And indeed the narrative here about the friend group moving past that and reconnecting is about that, and is quite good. But that‚Äôs not Sunny‚Äôs conflict, and I‚Äôd go as far to say if that was Sunny‚Äôs conflict, the game would be quite boring, and extremely predictable. If you address the game with that at its core, you HAVE to go about it with a certain answer, even more so than the current iteration of the game, making much of the development an exercise in inevitability. \n\nHonestly I hold almost the exact opposite opinion on this, suicide is the perfect red herring to introduce this story, in both a textual and metatextual context. Both inside the story and in the expectations of the game, by using the expected point of suicide as a leaping point, Omori is allowed to explore a much richer and more novel narrative, and I applaud Omocat for having the balls to do so.",

Then that person leaves to move somewhere new??? what is he going to do. I want answers. He deserves to heal and find happiness.

Also, Omori stabs themselves multiple times... which is a double-edged sword *^(pun)*, albeit the game does effectively use it for one of the neutral endings.\n\nA few pieces of Black Space, along with Sunny not getting out of bed for 4 years, imply severe trauma, which... i guess is just wiped away in the end? The game doesn't make any of it a threat, it's just something that you are aware that exists.\n\nLet's not forget that Sunny basically gets over the overwhelming guilt that he had from *killing* Mari... in what, a few hours of remembering ruined times, along with confronting a variant of himself that had been running in circles for 4 years?\n\nSure it was an accident, problem is, he's the reason it happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe overall trauma, along with the \"\"suicide\"\" and the option to actually off yourself, isn't that much of a threat, despite the horrifying results. It's something that pops up like the word \"whip-lash\" would imply, and it can be avoided, and started, via as much as a single click of a button. It's not constant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do like the game, there's a reason why i am here, despite the dislike of some stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, and towards your post... your opinion is, in my own opinion, correct.

    "selftext": "*clap* ‚Ä¶Okay\n\nBefore I go off the deep end I just want to clarify two things. One: I do not intend to insult or offend anyone directly, but I‚Äôm sorry if I do anyways. Two: I am not really a fan of shipping in general. This isn‚Äôt going to be me dunking on this ship just to prop up another. This is all to say that despite everything about to be said, I really truly honestly don‚Äôt want another stupid shipping war to tear this fandom apart. We good? Okay.\n\nAs already stated, I‚Äôm not much of a shipper, not in this fandom or in others. I generally don‚Äôt hate ships either though. Whether Sunflower, Sunburn, freaking Sunny D or whatever, I let people like what they like. Photobomb is the only exception and that is only because I‚Äôve never seen a ship that makes this little sense, get this much attention, for this freaking long.\n\nFor the first point, given the plot, there is no chance in hell that Aubrey and Basil would date. Aubrey >!bullied Basil relentlessly FOR 4 YEARS, got all her friends in on it, and nearly drowned him.!< Why would he date her?! Basil >!hung Aubrey‚Äôs sister figure like a stuck pig, lied about it FOR 4 YEARS, and nearly killed their mutual friend.!< Why would she date him?! What do people see in this pairing? It‚Äôs more dysfunctional than Spaceboy and Sweetheart!\n\nNow, despite all of that, I originally didn‚Äôt hate this ship anymore than any other. As long as it wasn‚Äôt shoved down my face I wouldn‚Äôt care seeing it anymore than seeing Sunflower or Cotton Candy. But oh my god, this ship has been posted on this subreddit nearly daily for LITERAL MONTHS. It‚Äôs like a song that keeps getting played on the radio. At first you don‚Äôt mind, but gradually you get tired of listening to it. It‚Äôs starts to get annoying but it keeps playing nearly everyday until you full on hate it.\n\nI‚Äôve gone from indifferent, to annoyed, to full on loathing. I mean christ guys, I think the fandom focuses too much on ships in general but it‚Äôs especially bad when it‚Äôs a ship that actively annoys me. This game means so much; it‚Äôs about depression, trauma, isolation, forgiveness, and so much more, but people only want to see the teens kiss. At least the Sunburn fans got the idea to make their own subreddit to dump all their reposted art.\n\nI know I‚Äôm going to get downvoted to hell and frankly I deserve it. I know I‚Äôm being a real freaking baby about people online pairing fictional characters in ways I don‚Äôt like. I‚Äôm just so sick of seeing the same ship every single second on this subreddit that I needed to get this off my chest. I‚Äôm going to take a break from this subreddit for my own sake as much as for everyone else‚Äôs I assume. I can only hope this trend will have died down by the time I cool off and come back.

But so is Sunburn, Sunflower, etc.\n\nIn case of Photobomb it's mostly just the \\~3 active users (pro-tip: if you block those select few you won't see their posts anymore) that do so. It actually is among the least popular MC-ships alongside Kelbrey (I'd argue Cotton Candy, a side-character-ship is more popular than it).\n\nPhotobomb is a relatively small community, and unlike the more popular ships (Sunburn and Sunflower) doesn't really display the shipping-typical overly toxic excesses.\n\nAs for what you said on why you think the ship doesn't work: \n\nWether a ship (or literally any story-element actually) work is dependent on how people interpret the narrative framework. In terms of ships it is mostly dependant on how players perceive the characters and how they would react to certain plot-elements.\n\nAnd the main-reason why Photomb has people that actually ship it is precisely because their perfectly valid interpretation is very different from your own. Saying that Photobomb is 'objectively bad' essentially constitutes gate-keeping.\n\nThat being said: Are your points valid? Yes!\n\nHowever. Those issues are not exclussive to Photobomb. Pretty much any Sunny- or Basil-ship has the same issues, if not worse - yet Sunflower and Sunburn (both of which imho are way more problematic than Suntan and Cactiflower yet are still eclipsing them btw) are among the top 3 ships in popularity.\n\nJust as an example:\n\n>>!Basil¬†hung Aubrey‚Äôs sister figure like a stuck pig, lied about it FOR 4 YEARS, and nearly killed their mutual friend.!<\n\nAll of those apply to Sunburn as well. With the addtional layer being that Sunny *also* >!killed said sister figure himself. !<And unlike with Basil,>! it's one-sided. Aubrey did not really wrong Sunny in a meaningfull way. !<\n\nOn the other hand, Aubrey >!feeling sorry about bullying Basil might make her more likely to forgive Basil and try to make up with him!< - the same cannot be said about Sunny.\n\nWhat this rant of yours comes off as is dunking on a niche-ship because \"it's more popular than I personally think it has any right to be\" while ignoring that ships with equal or worse problems are actually popular to the point of being mainstream.\n\nYou are complaining about an issue that is virtually imaginary (since Photobomb is not nearly as popular as you make it out to be) based on a subjective opinion, and simultaniously ignore that other shipping-communities *actually do* dispay what you are criticisizing about Photobomb.",

Someone might not know how to cook a stake but can have a vivid imagination like Sunny and be smart in other areas of life. Plus, he is still suffering, that can literally make even normal things hard. I don't know how to cook or heath up a stake at 16 but I'm good at storytelling and various other things, which doesn't make me dumb. I was never thought how to do this crap and I don't wanna blow my house up, it makes me incapable yes but I don't really have to eat a stake, I can just find something else to eat. I also am suffering from depression and OCD which drain you and as I said, they can make even basic things look hard. I guess what Im trying to say is that this does not mean Sunny is dumb, but incapable and that you can be smart but not smart for EVERYTHING. Intelligence is really a vague concept since, as I said, someone can be considered smart from just a single field they are good at and be dumb for something completely different. You can't really base their intelligence of of you too since everyone is different and has their field + there's the aspect of trauma. Now you got me curious about things each main character of Omori is smart for (like the subject that they know the most of and stuff). No one is intelligent for everything no matter how you turn it, someone will always have strengths and weaknesses no matter how smart they are. Sorry for the rambling. Also doesn't the steak have grill marks on it or something meaning it was cooked and he is reheating it? Doesn't that mean it can be put in the microwave since it was done and then frozen?",

I mean you can argue that if she really did commit suicide, the story could have given her more depth, exploring how a seemingly cheerful girl could just commit suicide like that. Like what kind of issues did she suffer from that she decided suicide is the way out? Just for how long was she hiding those issues to the point she could hide them so impeccably? Did she hesitate or was she at peace with her decision? But with the twist, it was just that Sunny killed her, and to some that can be really boring.\n\nEdit:\n\nThis post borrowed heavily from this [post](https://www.tumblr.com/woodchipp/773002921010987008/ive-seen-some-people-point-this-out-before-so-i?source=share),\n\nForgot to credit them, apologies ",

If he had no part in what happened, then what does he have to overcome? And Mari's death being an accident is a great but devastating end for her. She loved her little brother and hated mistakes, so her death being a series of mistakes that led to him accidentally killing her is just really poetic. Besides it's not like she doesn't have agency, we still see her spirit trying to guide Sunny to the truth, and she has chosen to still love and support her brother in death.",

And maybe it was overthinking the little details of her being a role model to others whose perfectionist and overachiever mindset was stressing herself out over getting the recital right contributed to her death. But I was neglecting the significance of those hints throughout the story and the importance of Basil and Sunny arc. I now recognize Omori's story wouldn't make sense or be as memorable if Mari did kill herself. \n\nIt's why I'm really excited about the Rainy Mari mod.

    "selftext": "First of all, no, I'm not talking about the Mari rolling down plot twist, but the one about Aubrey's house. (Sorry for the misleading title, but if I mentioned that it was about Aubrey the spoiler tag would be for nothing).\n\nYes, surely in your first gameplay that plot twist about the conditions in which Aubrey lives left you speechless, you felt bad for her and etc. etc. etc., but from my point of view this plot twist makes no sense and even affects the narrative quality of the game, and I even think it would be better without it in the story in first place, why? let me explain to you: \n\nLet's first take into account that Aubrey does not seem to match the living conditions in which she lives: she has dyed hair, clean and even modern clothes for the time (90s/2000s), she has a rabbit pet that is still alive after 4 years, so she has money to buy Bun Bun food (and I don't know about you but in my town rabbit food is very expensive). \nI know you will say that just because she is poor does not mean that she shouldn't be able to have casual clothes, but let's remember that she is not only poor, she is literally EXTREME POVERTY, you can consider yourself poor if you earn little money but there is literally **any money provider**, and she surely depends on being invited to eat by her friends to feed herself, just even dyeing her hair is a total luxury for her.\n\nAlso, where tf does Aubrey's mother get money for so many beers and alcohol? Normally this would fit more assuming her father is still there, and her mother is there wasting his money on her addictions, but it's just a plot hole that doesn't fit the situation, this whole combination of factors leads to the point where things would be more natural if Aubrey had a normal house, with her father still there, and she would still suffer a bit of intra-family conflict and that would be why she hate being at home, sounds cliche but it would be less exaggerated and she would fit in more. (I clarify that it is fine that the plot twists are a surprise but the magic is in feeling stupid for not seeing it coming and that the creators left the subtle clues, but this? It's just like putting chocolate in the salad: you put something exaggerated in something that was already good without it) \n\nAnd why do I say that this damages the narrative quality of the game? Well, there are 2 reasons:\n\n1‚Ä¢ this would be continuing with that annoying stereotype of \"all bullies are poor and with dysfunctional families\" **NO**... bullies come out due to bad education, or they simply like to bother their \"inferiors\" classmates for ego or narcissism, the cases of difunctional families are not as voluminous as they seem, but it is the most romanticized and used in stories.\n\n2‚Ä¢ it's totally irrelevant to the story, so it's not crazy to say that this would only be a cheap way to make Aubrey's character \"more tragic\", a way to make you feel bad for her and forgive her for all her social crimes, **NO**... things are not like that, it is natural that we suffer from our traumas and our past but there comes a part of life in which you are totally responsible for your actions and you cannot use your backstory to justify it, making a character sympathetic only by making it tragic is the cheapest way of writing, as it says in the book \"THE SCIENCE OF STORYTELLING by Will Storr\", a character must be empathizable and endearing on its own, the story and plot should only serve as a way to support them but the important thing is is to **write them well**, If your character depends on the plot to be acceptable to the viewer, then you can already be sure that its a bad character (although this applies more with Sunny). \nAubrey's character would have been fine with just her concept: a broken girl who became aggressive for losing the only people she could call \"family\" to, the character is tragic on her own, and even she may be perfect as a secondary villain without needing to victimize her (You know, one of those villains who have a tragic past but the main reason you like them is because they are good antagonists). \nOn the 3rd day the characters just forgive Aubrey just like that and she leaves her 4 year resentment away with a simple intervention and the \"power of friendship\", which despite being something forced, terribly written, and impossible to happen in real life... at least it solved everything, but that ruins her character, ruining her in terms of writing and considerably damaging the quality of the game's narrative.\n\nThis is only a point of view, if you want to debate the topic in the comments, Im open to more opinions, good day!",

    "selftext": "Sunny would be great as a side character but him being the character with the least amount of willingness to do anything good, along with the fact that nothing that you is able to truly change the course of events in any meaningful way (ill explain why below) left me frustrated with Omori in a way I havent been before. So I wrote this whole post about the MC.\n\nThe bad routes: All of the bad endings are a result of Sunny's deliberate indifference to the world around him in favor of self-preservation. If we are to view the bad endings as canon in any way, I think they say a lot about what kind of person Sunny has become after the tragedy, and before anyone tries to excuse his behavior in these endings as \"trauma\", remember Basil went through the same trauma and doesn't willfully let the people around him get hurt to save his own image like Sunny does. And if you don't want to believe the bad endings are canon, why would Omocat add so many of them in the first place with so much content? I think the bad endings exist at the very least to give us insight into Sunny's personality, since they are choices that Sunny genuinely considers valid, unlike helping Basil in the bathroom.\n\nThe \"good\"/ true route: I've been seeing people say that \"Sunny saves Basil\" so that shows hes a good person. I reject the claims that he saved Basil out of selflessness both times and heres why. At the lake, Sunny has the \"choice\" to jump in and save Basil or not, if you choose yes, like a human with functioning empathy would in this situation, you jump in and quickly forget about basil and try to focus on not being afraid, before both you and Basil are rescued by Hero; \"but Sunny meant to save Basil\" no he didnt, he never jumped in the lake to save Basil in the first place. Why do I believe this? Well if you click \"No\" to saving Basil at the lake, Sunny will be redirected beck to the pier by Kel who says he should save Basil, so Sunny, like in most of Omori, was acting in order to preserve his REPUTATION not Basil, he wanted to LOOK like he was saving Basil; considering he pretty much tries to let Basil die in every single ending (ill justify that in the last paragraph), he may have been trying to let him drown \"accidentally\" (sounds like what happened with Mari a bit huh?).\n\n\"You can't just dismiss the lake situation and assume Omori was defending his reputation!\" Youre right I can't do that, unless, hes done it before and does it again afterwards for the same reason, which he does in Omori. Both when he hung his sister up and when he deliberately stayed quiet about the photos he scribbled over, which led to Basil being bullied into suicidality, and Aubrey being hated and ostracized by Kel; he did both of those things just to save face. I think this is Sunny's biggest flaw, he doesnt care about anyone else, he, much like many iconic villians with ASPD (think Bateman), only really cares about his image and his own feelings; and I think this horrible behavior started when he first hung up Mari on his tree, we dont know if she was alive at the time she was hung up after all, he may have killed herin the process  just to save face after the accident.\n\nAnd for the last point I want to address the true route's ending. Sunny \"saving\" Basil in his room. Much like at the lake, Sunny very much considers completely walking away from Basil while he needs to be \"saved\" again. The text box \"Save Basil?\" shows up again and exists either as Omocat or Sunny trying to convince the reader that Sunny is being heroic here just like at the lake, but given the events I find that very hard to believe. Then he goes in the room, what happens? Well the whole interaction is very confusing and muddy but hospital scenes should give us some clues.\n\nSunny has one injury, his eye. Basil? His face and head is covered in bandages. So what I think happened is, Sunny enters, Basil, is caught off guard about to kill himself and hides the scissors. Basil starts crying and Sunny immediately tries to abandon him, no choice for us, hes blocked by his something (not sure what that means but it must represent an irrational reason), and then Basil, viewed as a something consuming him, HUGS Sunny. From our POV we start taking \"damage\" from Basil \"reaching inside\" Sunny when he talks to him. Basil isn't attacking Sunny, hes talking to him and Sunny is freaking out! So Sunny beats the crap out of Basil, and injures him until Basil defends himself out of pain and accidentally stabs Sunny. Sunny then either wakes up and kills himself or ignores Basil and tries to explain why he just beat the crap out of Basil to all his friends who are notably only surrounding Basil. We never see what he actually says by the way, I wouldn't be surprised if he omitted some important truths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, in my opinion Sunny is arguably the villian if his story and he does little if anything at all to actually correct his wrongs in 1 out of 5 endings.",

Sunny's story would not work as a side character, there are reasons for the things he does, hes been locked in his house for 4 years after killing his sister by accident without seeing anyone but his mom, he spent most of his days sleeping, barely eating, living in this fantasy world he made for himself to forget everything, where everything is bright, everything is new, everything is different, different from the real world. All these things are for sure going to mess with the way he thinks, he has to think in a different very suddenly because he was locked up for 4 years, but all those things i mentioned add to the story and add to the main character, the story is better as sunny being the main character, and a big part of it is him being messed up.",

Sure, the event is the same, but the traumas incurred from it are two different beasts, to two different people. \n\nI don't understand the assumption that Mari was alive when they hung her. It seems kind of wild to me to think she survived that fall, and then twelve year old Sunny and Basil either didn't bother to check if she was dead, or decided to finish the job. They wouldn't have hung her if she wasn't dead. The idea that this twelve year old was so worried about his \"\"\"image\"\"\" that he hung his still-breathing sister from a tree (and that Basil helped him do it!) is, like, comically evil, and makes the whole game harder to take seriously. \n\nI think Sunny accidentally killed his sister, Basil bore witness to it and tried to help in the only way he could think of, and now their whole lives are intertwined with each other's guilt and resentment. Basil's response to this trauma is to reach out to the only person who may understand; Sunny's response is to shut everything out and escape. No one in this story is healthy. People were always, always going to get hurt. It's not about his image, it's about some very hard truths that Sunny just cannot confront. The pain and sorrow regarding what happened to Mari is everywhere he turns in his own town. \n\nIt just seems like... kind of an oversimplification, to only ever assume the worst in Sunny's actions.",

        "body": "I kind of want to defend sunny here, just for the sake of debate, and honestly I feel like the reasons he does some of the things he does is because he's scared of hurting someone again, or making things worse. \n\nWe see through his interactions with Omori (who is an extension of himself) that he feels extremely guilty for what he did, saying that he ruined everyone's lives, and that could be why he runs away from basil in the bathroom, or starts freaking out. And he's prone to hallucinating, so you are probably right about him attacking basil first. Honestly it would be quite the plot twist for him to just tell them that he attacked basil, not that he accidentally pushed Mari. \n\nBut.. to be honest, as much as we get to see of Sunny, we don't actually get to see his thoughts, (when he's not examining something) how he's feeling, except when he's scared, hallucinating, or talking to Omori. We only get to judge his actions, and a lot of his actions kind of feel a little.. messed up on first glance. But if you look at it as him being scared of messing things up and feeling as though he doesn't deserve his friends it changes. \n\nHowever my main retaliation to this claim is that, during the scene where Aubrey has the pinwheel and puts it on the stump of the tree, and the group hug happening he's immediately hesitant to hug, backing away, and it doesn't seem like that would be what someone would do if they only had their reputation in mind. It more so gives off, \"what if I mess it up?\" And \"do I really deserve this\". But hey, maybe he just really really doesn't like physical contact, but I doubt that. \n\nBut I guess, we don't really know, because we don't actually get to see his thoughts in the real world, only his dreams, and he's clearly very fond of everyone considering how he made a mental fabrication of each of them. So it could just be him being scared of messing everything up by accident, just like with Mari. \n\nThe way I see it, Sunny just might feel like he can't do anything right because of his mistake, not that he's trying to preserve his reputation. That's why he isolated himself, he didn't want to cause any more issues, because if he pushed Mari, what's stopping him from pushing someone else? \n\nBut hey, let me know if this makes sense, cause it's just me trying to argue back, and I don't think Sunny is a good person, but I don't think he's evil either, he just got too caught up in his own thoughts.\n\nEdit: to add to this, we see basil die several times in black space, and it might be Sunny feeling as though even his presence puts people in danger, because in all of them (correct me if I'm wrong) Sunny doesn't kill basil, and in alot of them basil just straight up dies suddenly.",

Except you‚Äôre kinda taking this point and running with it, and making some really questionable inferences along the way. \n\nHow exactly was hanging Mari a move solely to save face? I agree that he‚Äôs culpable to an extent there, but he‚Äôs basically out of his mind, the motive falls mostly on Basil. And even then, the much stronger interpretation is that he‚Äôs doing it to hide the truth from himself, not try to escape justice, that‚Äôs why the core conflict is Sunny vs himself and not Sunny vs the gang and/or the law. \n\nWhat exactly is this headcanon for the final confrontation with Basil? I‚Äôve seen people do this before and I just don‚Äôt get it, you‚Äôre taking the events that happened pretty clearly in the narrative and disregarding them to insert your own hypothesis of what actually happened. Well alright smart guy, if that‚Äôs the real story, why didn‚Äôt Omocat tell it like that? What sense does it make to tell a story in a way that requires you as the audience to purposefully throw away and consider irrelevant emotionally charged pieces of the narrative? Just sit down and think about it from a wider perspective for a second, it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to structure it that way. \n\nAll in all, yea, Sunny is his own villain, again, that‚Äôs the point of the game and the heart of the conflict. That is both Sunny and Basil‚Äôs core problem in the story, that they both refuse to accept that evil lies within the heart of every man, that every person is capable of inflicting great suffering. You‚Äôve found yourself on the ground floor of the core conflict. Now just follow it along the rails that Omocat set to its natural conclusion, reconciliation with that potential and taking responsibility, understanding that your sins don‚Äôt define you and before you can seek forgiveness from others, you must forgive yourself.",

    "selftext": "(Sorry in advance for the sheer amount of spoiler flags.)\n\n>!I'm going to be completely honest, when I first played the game, getting all the endings to the game and playing both the Hikikomori route and the Sunny route, I absolutely loved the story to the game and the way that the game was taking it. I especially really thought the arcs to the characters were well written and that the ending was shockingly good. For the next week, around the time I had my second playthrough, I was completely infatuated with the game, playing it for hours on end.!<\n\n>!However, looking back now, having played more indie games and learning more about story writing and proper story structure, I can't say I really feel the same way I did then. In fact, I have a hard time even admitting that I liked the ending to the game at all first or even how some of the characters are developed.!<\n\n>!There are so many things I could start by saying with the story, but the first thing I want to mention is just how it doesn't make sense how some of the characters act in these situations. It makes no sense how Mari, someone who has to deal with the stress of having to basically parent her older brother, deal with school, deal with neglective parents, do piano, take college prep classes, and be a role model for her younger friends while still maintaining a more romantic relationship with Hero, ends up mainly really having issues with perfectionism while her little brother is so bad with emotional control and boundaries despite her guidance that he ends up pushing her to her death and also throwing his violin down the stairs instead of talking to her about how he's mad and how he doesn't want to play (I know it's difficult to talk about being burnt out with these types of instruments with your teachers, especially when you don't want to let your them down, but as someone who played both the flute and drums and got burnt out after the first year for both, I can attest to how talking to your teacher really makes a difference, especially when there is an event like a performance coming up. I will admit that playing the drums and the flute is usually considered far easier than the violin, and my teachers weren't as perfectionistic as Mari, but still, Mari is shown to likely be more unaware of Sunny's predicament with practicing rather than negligent.)!<\n\n>!(Also, yes, Sunny and Mari's parents are shown to be very neglectful in the story, but I don't want to keep you here all day, so feel free to look it up on the Omori wiki about the mom and dad. Links at the bottom of the post.)!<\n\n>!Another thing that I hate is how the message is about forgiving yourself, yet when Sunny breaks the violin and pushes Mari down the stairs, he does so purely through premeditated anger for the violin, and impulsive anger for pushing Mari, which isn't fully warranted considering that he hasn't fully exhausted his options to where he should logically come to that. Mari doesn't grab Sunny or do anything to warrant physical battery, so when Sunny does this, he is completely within the realm of committing 3rd degree murder from a legal perspective, Sunny could've told Mari that he needed time to cool down in order to listen to her, as well. Also, assuming Mari survived, what point did he make? that he's going to physically shove Mari around to get his way? Killing her that way is not something I would forgive in someone, even her death was technically an accident and he technically cared about her.!<\n\n>!What's worse is the fact that instead of calling an ambulance in the event that she might possibly be capable of resuscitation and recovery (Since spinal cord shock or fracture can cause cardiac arrest but doesn't always cause death, since oxygen remains in the body for around 10 minutes after the heart stops beating, and she can still possibly be brought back, albeit, probably disabled from the neck down if it is a fracture, excluding complications along the way, that really turn it to chance, such as brain damage in regards to lack of oxygen, which can cause seizures.). Sunny then just brings her up to her bed, causing her to undeniably die by losing all the oxygen in her body since she's not breathing. And then, as if that already wasn't terrible enough, Basil comes over and convinces Sunny to stage it as a suicide by hanging her, which is absolutely morally unforgivable, and very illegal, being considered \"desecrating a body\", which is classified as a felony with a maximum sentence of 10 years prison time (which might be a little different, though, since they are both minors. Also, I'm saying this from the perspective of US law, which I don't know much about law in Japan, where this takes place, but still, I would imagine it would be illegal nonetheless since in the story Basil mainly does it to protect Sunny from being arrested, although this is inferred.)!<\n\n\n\n>!In summary, I do not think that the whole \"forgiveness\" message correlates well at all with the way the events play out. If I were to rewrite it to fit in the story, I would do it as such:!<\n\n\n\n>!1.     The broken violin incident would stem from Sunny and Mari ended up not getting along or compromising with the recital, with Mari ignoring her brother's wishes not to perform because she wants him to succeed and do well, and having Sunny being unmoving with not wanting to perform out of fear of doing poorly or ruining music as a hobby for her. I would also add depth to their music, to where Sunny really enjoyed playing the violin at first, but began to fear that Mari would end up making things too exhausting for him to work on and take away time with his friends, causing him to become bitter knowing how much time he's put into music for her and stressing him out.!<\n\n\n\n>! 2.    During the actual incident, Sunny and Mari have one last argument where Sunny makes a stand to not perform, while Mari tries to pressure him to, causing him to destroy the violin to stop her from trying to make him bend to her will. Then, during the argument, Sunny would eventually get tired of arguing and try to walk away in order to calm down, but Mari would grab his arm and try to hold him back, causing him to struggle to get away, and eventually, accidentally push her down the stairs.!<\n\n\n\n>!3.     Then, Basil, who overheard the argument but didn't want to interrupt, sees Sunny grieving over Mari's body, eventually comes over, ushering Sunny to call an ambulance, which he immediately does and have him promise not to tell anyone about it and instead, fearing Sunny will be arrested and taken away, lie about it and tell them that she tripped while carrying his violin for him to the music room after he left it upstairs. Once the police and paramedics arrive, the police question them and stay until their parents get home, eventually ruling them out as innocent and not arresting Sunny. Then, Mari is taken to the hospital, where she later passes away from a seizure and cardiac arrest several days later, caused by lack of oxygen from the time it took for the ambulance to arrive. Then, after expensive emergency procedures to try and help her, the dad ends up paying for them before leaving from grief.!<\n\n\n\n\n\n>!If the story was more like this, yes, it would be radically different and change many aspects of the story, but I think it would, in my opinion, be beneficial to the story by making Sunny and Basil much more sympathetic characters by showing that they really wanted to help, even if they were unsuccessful in the end. That, and I believe that showing Mari and Sunny having more equivalent faults is important, since it would mean the story is more about the both of them coming to terms with the fact that they both made mistakes, learning that ultimately they were really just trying to look out for the other, and that they should've listened better to each other. That, and it makes the ending to the Sunny route more believable as a happy ending, since the friend group, even after learning about it all this way, would still likely forgive Sunny and Basil, since both of them had their faults in what they did, yes, but would likely understand why they acted how they did, and that they really, deep down, just wanted to help by looking out for the ones they care about. Yes, the original game shows that they tried to look out for each other, but it still makes Basil seem manipulative for doing the hanging, and it writes Sunny to be a loose canon who can't control himself when he throws his violin down the stairs and pushes Mari instead of talking to her, leaving a bad taste in your mouth since you know that the friend group just won't be able to just simply forgive them, mainly for what they did by hanging her afterwards, but also since Sunny didn't have a strong reason to break his violin since he hasn't really fully exhausted his options yet, and seems to do it when Mari is just likely unaware of what he's been going through with having to practice for the performance.!<\n\n\n\n>!But that's just my thoughts on it. Feel free to share your thoughts, questions, and opinions below. By the way, if you were curious as to why I mentioned why Sunny's parents are neglective, feel free to read about them at their respective wiki sites.!<\n\n\n\n>!The mom: [https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/SUNNY%27S\\_MOM](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/SUNNY%27S_MOM)!<\n\n\n\n>!The dad: [https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/SUNNY%27S\\_DAD](https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/SUNNY%27S_DAD)!<",

Even with the explanation of Basil wanting to protect Sunny, it would have been far more realistic for him to >!lie directly to police rather than stage a suicide.!< \n\nBut thinking about the characterization of Mari and Sunny, the build-up of what actually happened made sense to me. >!Mari was clearly desperate to fulfill the expectations people had of her, and judging from what little we know and see of her parents, they clearly did nothing but add to the pressure. Perfectionists are very good at masking their insecurities, especially when others project their expectations onto them. She mimicked the idea of the perfect sister around the people she liked to not disappoint them. She‚Äôs only ever shown snippets of her frustration to the friend group (Kel‚Äôs recounting of the spilled drink) but has never had a full meltdown. It makes sense that the only person who‚Äôd ever see her genuine feelings bubbling on the surface would be Sunny since they live together. And I think that‚Äôs something they both share. They *both* are terrible at expressing their negative feelings, Sunny just has a harder time expressing most emotions in general.!<\n\n>!In Basil‚Äôs photo album, we see that Sunny is more passive. In all the dynamics he shares with his companions, he‚Äôs always the listener or smaller personality, even with Hero and Basil. I think the game has always shown him to be somewhat emotionally constipated, and clearly conflict avoidant (his fight option in RW is hesitant.) So, imagine how he feels when his own sister places all of these expectations he clearly has no idea what to do with onto him. He doesn‚Äôt want to hurt her, he doesn‚Äôt want to upset her, but he‚Äôs wondering *why* is she making him feel like this? It‚Äôs unfortunate, but it makes sense why *both* of them ended up exploding at each other.!<\n\nSo, the build-up had always made sense to me, and it‚Äôs tragic because it absolutely could‚Äôve been avoided. The actual event itself could‚Äôve been written with a direction that made more sense, but I personally give it props for being able to hook you in when it‚Äôs actually presented.

It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve familiarized myself with it***\n\nIf you ask the community who their favorite character is, an overwhelming and, in my opinion, very surprising number of people will give the same answer, Basil. \n\nNow Basil stans, don‚Äôt come at me. If you don‚Äôt think too hard about his character, he‚Äôs a very cute and charming boy. He was my second favorite (after Hero) when I first installed the game and didn‚Äôt know anything about its plot line and lore. However.\n\nTaking the game‚Äôs lore into consideration, Basil is an awful character. Yes, he was there for Sunny, and in a way helped him heal. But if not for Basil, Sunny wouldn‚Äôt have had to do nearly as much healing. Their friend group could have supported each other more and even stayed together. Sunny wouldn‚Äôt be tormented by Something for the years following Mari‚Äôs death. \n\nAfter all, it was BASIL who walked in on Mari‚Äôs death scene. BASIL who didn‚Äôt call the police. BASIL who suggested framing Mari‚Äôs accidental death as a SUICIDE. Which, in my opinion, was the most disgusting and disrespectful thing they could have done to Mari‚Äôs body. Not to mention, this caused Sunny to not only grieve the death of his sister, but also have to sit with the fact that her entire character was stained with a lie he agreed to fabricate because he probably couldn‚Äôt see any other option. It was BASIL who caused the group to split up. BASIL who kept getting lost in headspace. BASIL who (completely in my opinion) seemingly wanted more attention from Sunny after HIS SISTER LITERALLY DIED. Even the fabricated Basil that played in headspace with Omori was always needing to be saved or cheered up or tended to. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying Sunny isn‚Äôt at fault in these scenarios. He most definitely is. But, had Basil not walked in on the scene, I have no doubts the story would have played out very differently. I feel anyone is easily persuaded and doesn‚Äôt think right in situations as traumatic and awful as Sunny had to experience. \n\nAgain, don‚Äôt come at me for this but I‚Äôm more than welcome to hear your opinions and takes on Basil!",

Blackspace is a montage of Omori torturing and killing Basil in increasingly brutal ways, both to silence the Truth and to vent Sunny's implicit resentment towards Basil for making everything worse. That's why Basil, in every form he takes, apologizes and begs for forgiveness. He *knows* that what he did was wrong, that his attempt to protect Sunny made everything worse.\n\nBasil's guilt has manifested as a giant maw eating him alive. He is caught up in so many lies that he thinks there's no escape. He literally says this on 2 Days Left. There are hints throughout the early game that Basil was planning to commit suicide out of guilt. His grandma dying was the straw that broke the camel's back and Sunny showing up last minute only to abandon him *again* drove him over the edge.\n\nBasil is Sunny's scapegoat. The Church scene is the story asking Sunny, \"Will you leave your friend to die to protect yourself and bury the Truth?\" In every ending except one, the answer is yes.\n\nBasil isn't an ontologically evil person. But what he did was *wrong* and nothing, not even the plot itself, lets him forget that.",

He's got a role within the story and the friend group and he fufills it perfectly. He's complex and functional and I like him as a character. \n\nAs a person, he's morally grey. He had good intentions but he made the wrong decision. He made the wrong decision and I think it's completely valid to hate him when you treat him as a person. His actions are morally wrong and caused a lot of grief for other people. \n\nI like him as a person because he was young and panicked and clearly feels bad about it, but my word is not law and I'm glad that we all have different takes - including not liking him as a person. I just think that he is a good character in the way that a character you're supposed to hate is - well written with a clear-cut personality and motives. He's a good character but not a good person.",

    "selftext": "This is a vent/rant so I can move on in my life. \n\nI am a person who struggles with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. If you loved this game and it means a lot to you I am glad. If it helped you cope with your own mental health I am ecstatic. This is just my own personal opinion. Warning: my writing can get a bit convoluted and I may end up repeating points. Also I have dyslexia so spelling‚Ä¶\n\n\nFirst: I think the character of Sunny was poorly made. They took a character that you empathize with‚Ä¶until you realize that Sunny KILLED his sister and then participated in the cover up!!!! What the actual f*ck!?! That‚Äôs some dark sh*t. What‚Äôs worse‚Ä¶that cover up was none other than a staged suicide. Don‚Äôt worry, I do not think Basil is innocent either, but at most is only an accomplice. Sunny still went along with the cover up. Could have immediately called someone. Or at least afterwords confessed. Which brings me to my second point. \n\nSecond: Sunny, at least as far as I could tell, was a socially awkward kid before the event. However, there were no evidence of depression from him before nor does the game seem to state it. It says he doesn‚Äôt like to smile‚Ä¶that proves nothing. Plenty of people don‚Äôt like to smile, even during photos where they may feel self conscious. Thus, my personal conclusion is that the depression and suicide was the direct after effect that comes with accidentally killing your own sister and then, instead of telling the truth, staging it as a suicide. Which is not only disrespectful to the victim but also everyone else!!!! But beside the obvious issue of manslaughter and such, my biggest disgust stems from Sunny‚Äôs mental health portrayal. \n\nThird: Sunny‚Äôs mental health is used to make the players feel sorry for him and make him the hero. Make him seem a victim who is unjustly punishing himself. Wait‚Ä¶unjustly? He accidentally killed his sister. Okay that‚Äôs bad but he could have told the truth. Explained it was an accident and Lilly get on with his life. But no, instead of getting help he drags the body back to bed. Okay that‚Äôs just shock. Gets worse. His friend comes and gets him to help stage it as a suicide. Sunny cooperates. (People condemn Basil but he was really just a dumb kid trying to help his friend, what he did was bad but not as bad as Sunny in my opinion.). After all this is done he‚Ä¶kept the secret for 4 years!!! No sh*t he‚Äôs suicidal and got depression!!! That‚Äôs cause he know what he did was wrong!!! The writers shouldn‚Äôt have used his mental health as a tool to get people to root and empathize with him. No hints or subtle clues that he was mentally unwell before, if they wanted to the writers should have wrote that in. Sunny‚Äôs mental state in the game is the direct result of 4 years of guilt, justified guilt. Brings me to my fourth. \n\nFourth: I feel that depression and suicide, while being more openly talked about, are still largely used to make people feel okay when justifying bad or downright immoral behavior from characters writers want you to root for. Mental health does not excuse bad choices. I was disappointed to find this game is not about depression or anxiety but a person trying to get over their own, justified, guilt. \n\nHere‚Äôs a link I believe also explains it well: https://peppermintbee.tumblr.com/post/644426605009223680/omoris-poor-writing-part-2?is_related_post=1",

        "body": "Well it all came down to the fact that you expected the game to be about depression rather than anything else which could make sense. If you wanted a character solely about Depression i believe Basil would have been exactly that. Unfortunately he doesn't get enough time screen for most of us to emphasise enough. \n\nHowever, depression and guilt are at the same core basically the same thing with the end of moving on and the guilt about oneself even if not for the same reasons mainly accidentally murdering someone close or general disappointment about your current state. So I don't think separating them make all that much sense.\n\nI've also noticed that you have forgiven Basil far more than Sunny contrary to most of the Fandom .Clearly, you have only taken in account the end result because at no point during the Truth sequence with the photos and their descriptions, at no point was it ever mentioned that Sunny ever actually intended in hurting Mari with instead wanting to run like he always want to do within the game as noted in his reaction to Aubrey's breakdown or the action boxes saying \"RUN !\" during traumatic areas. You can make the similarities with Basil whose goal was to protect Sunny by framing a suicide. Given the state of irrationality, shock and in Sunny's case full blown delusion thinking it's all a dream their insane actions are UNDERSTANDABLE but NOT JUSTIFIED and that's where a problem lies. People associate forgiveness with justification when in fact it is impossible. If an action is justified then it is not needed to forgive and if it isn't justified then you can only try to understand or reject which I think is where most of the Basil hate comes from after all It's irrational to believe people act rationally.\n\nNow personal time, I relate to Sunny because I'm also not an emotional person as such, in situations where I'm emotionally struck then It is a natural reflex to bottle it up until eventually it all goes off violently with possible severe consequences. Where I can't relate though is in the depression and feelings of worthlessness so I can only attempt at understanding with whatever knowledge I've amassed over my short years but yet I have in my mind forgiven both Basil and Sunny because I could see where they were coming from and I think that's something everyone has to be able to do at some point though that's probably never gonna happen. Yeah I'm not depressed but definitely nihilistic.",

        "body": "It‚Äôs unfortunate that the games stereotype is a ‚Äúquirky depression game‚Äù I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs where you got it from but it is a common misconception. The depression stems from the incident but this incident also created trauma for Sunny and Basil. The game largely deals with depictions of trauma, Sunny blocking out part of the incident and stuff around him and also escaping to headspace are coping mechanisms. Something as a whole.\n\nI‚Äôm not entirely sure what basil hallucinating and deluding himself into thinking something did the incident would be, like probably not a coping mechanism and more similar to psychosis, but it also seems to be a result of the incident (or maybe predates it, we don‚Äôt know).\n\nThe game never once justifies the characters actions but it does explain them and provides evidence for you to form explanations that aren‚Äôt just ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre psychopaths, oh they‚Äôre evil‚Äù because, believe it or not, this shit could happen in certain circumstances. In really, unfortunate circumstances, but if the cards line up just right, like they did, people who have emotions/empathy/aren‚Äôt complete pieces of shit can make these mistakes. \n\nFirst, they were 12. Their impulse/emotion control and their decision making would be out of wack. But I believe that‚Äôs a small component. In this case, Mari had been pushing him and pushing him leading up to the recital. Sunny appears to be a stoic person, opting to instead bottle up his emotions. Eventually, Mari pushed him for the last time and he snapped. He threw his violin first, she got angry, he wanted to leave‚Ä¶ but then she blocked the stairs. He wasn‚Äôt thinking beyond the immediate problem, and pushed her away out of anger.\n\nThen you know what happens, basil comes along, it was his idea to hang him, believing he would ‚Äúsave him‚Äù by doing so. Sunny is obviously pretty shocked at this point but agrees to help. There is a point where white space is formed during this incident, so that‚Äôs what starts its creation.\n\nAlready established how they responded to this which would make it so much harder to just come clean after it had happened, one possibly repressing a lot of their memories and the other not knowing the reality of it. \n\nA lot of this is based on the truth album text which is what‚Äôs is in the files but blocked out in game (specifically, the specifics of the incident) but, yeah, that‚Äôs what the game is about, more, guilt and trauma.",

They decide to call Sunny‚Äôs mom to explain the situation. She handles it semi-calmly. Eventually Mari recovers but they still hold a grudge against sunny, except for Basil and Kel. Mari and Aubrey dye their hair and basil decides to join in and die the front of his hair green. Some time passes and Mari has completely recovered and she starts a job at a clothing store. Hero then finds a job at a restraunt. All the others have part-time jobs besides Sunny (who mooches of of Kel) Kel works at a gym while Basil works at a plant shop. Aubrey works at a donut shop. Mari is very sweet and forgiving, while hero becomes unforgiving and anxiety ridden. Kel stays happy but is much more open since the accident, but Aubrey is cold but less mean.  Sunny is quiet and still has a headspace, instead called purple place. Sunny grows his hair out and seems a bit more‚Ä¶ feminine in nature, causing him to have a small gender crisis. He stops caring after a while though. Kel finally cut his hair and looks mostly the same otherwise. Hero‚Äôs hair is a bit more tame and Aubrey‚Äôs is a bit more feminine and classical with pink ends. Mari‚Äôs is raggedy with purple ends. Basil‚Äôs hair is a bit more fluffier with green ends. The picturds have been made in gacha.\n\n[Sandwich](https://preview.redd.it/kxuc7mey6idc1.jpg?width=734&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa1ee48e78a1686a5d34689d19ec92a21e49852d)\n\n[Happy boi :\\)](https://preview.redd.it/hk9y8krp6idc1.jpg?width=711&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfc9705344884b8dff0a67a99807c4866980143c)\n\n[Auby ](https://preview.redd.it/mcmzvupe6idc1.jpg?width=847&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=616c6bbba325cdeb4f6a5999ad219c516c9f5da9)\n\n[Babil](https://preview.redd.it/2nhrnp7a6idc1.jpg?width=764&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1a336d254db7720b9140c1550b913427525bfe4)\n\n[Snuuy ](https://preview.redd.it/31ndvqp46idc1.jpg?width=868&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9521036580362d4856a8de4e74e9fb921a8f018c)",

The game is just probably bugged or has a glitch that needs to be fixed by the developers, you need to give them time to fix the issue and then you will be able to play the game.\n\nTake The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe for example, the game was initallly intended to be released in 2019, with development starting in 2018, but the game's community was worried that a single year of development wasn't enough to make a good game, and so they INSISTED for the developers to delay the release of the game in order to make it as polished as possible. Year after year, the game was delayed again and again, but the fans kept waiting, they kept giving the developers more time to work on the issues of the game, and finally, in 4/27/2022 the game came out.\n\nThe Stanley Parble: Ultra Deluxe is a rare case of the community cooperating with the video game developers for a common goal, that is to have a quality game. Omori fans, you should take a page from this.",

Also this group of friends were her family, her family life was bad so for her friends to ‚Äúreject‚Äù her and be ‚Äúmean‚Äù must have been soul crushing. She is a flawed person that made completely wrong judgements and in doing so became a horrible person, but thats why shes a brilliant character, she dealt with it using anger and rejecting everyone and just making it in her head that they are all mean to her, which is unhealthy like Basil and Sunny.",

        "body": "I mean, you don‚Äôt have to like her, but each of these reasons is the point of her character. She‚Äôs a girl that‚Äôs pissed off at the world because it‚Äôs took the one good thing she had. Aubrey isn‚Äôt just an angry face and a rageful spirit, she has a flurry of negative emotions that she suppresses into rage. \n\n\n- She WAS abandoned though. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs the others fault, they just reacted differently. People react to negative situations differently, and unfortunately no one could meet her needs of coming together at the time. Plus, she had been socially outcasted before, so she has negative connotations with that.\n\n\n- She felt like she was the only one who couldn‚Äôt move on, because Mari was literally her only hope for a while. Mari was more of a motherly figure than her mother ever was, based on what her house looks like. Because with everyone moving on, she felt like everyone had just forgotten or not cared. \n\n\n- This is at the peak of her frustrations, and the moment we as the player realize that the sweet little girl from headspace is gone. I‚Äôm pretty sure that when we first meet Aubrey, she‚Äôs taken a bit back by the fact that Sunny is standing there. It‚Äôs a flurry of emotions she feels‚Ä¶but she simply resorts to her anger‚Ä¶because that‚Äôs how she survived for so long‚Ä¶why stop now?\n\n\n- Okay, yeah, there really is no justification for bullying Basil, and that‚Äôs the point. The whole point of Aubrey is to show one of the many extremes of what a person can become if they suppress their true emotions for too long. \n\n\n- Again, abandonment and rage are the two connecting forces that push her character. It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to use violent acts as a means to cry out for help. She‚Äôs pretty much a reflection of Basil in that sense, but just the opposite way, she has passed her breaking point and is just lashing out at people because she can‚Äôt take it anymore.\n\n\n- She‚Äôs kinda falling back to her rage again, but she also truly believes that what Basil did was horrible. From her point of view, ‚ÄòBasil‚Äô destroyed the only memento to their friendship and physical items that relate to Mari, and to her, those things are priceless. To her, it‚Äôs a heartless and selfish act. Again, it‚Äôs a flurry of confusion and bafflement that ultimately just has her fall back onto rage. \n\n\n- Again, she truly thinks Basil deserves it and that the two guys just don‚Äôt know the situation. She probably figures they wouldn‚Äôt listen to her anyways, so why even bother? Plus, she‚Äôs still angry at them, so why not just give them what they deserve. \n\n\n- Again, she believes the guys are too ‚Äòrighteous‚Äô to understand. She might also be afraid to talk about it in case the guys say ‚Äòthat doesn‚Äôt give you the right to bully him‚Äô. Because, again, the photo album and the memories of Mari are priceless to her, and if they have the conservation that it doesn‚Äôt justify her actions, it not only makes her face the fact that she‚Äôs acting terribly (a fact she already knows and tries to suppress) but also gives off the indication that the photo album never mattered that much . Therefore, their memories never mattered that much‚Ä¶their friendship never mattered that much‚Ä¶and if it doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶then why can‚Äôt she just move on? \n\n\n- Again, she feels the confusion of emotions flurrying within herself, so she falls back onto rage. I get she attacked him with a nailed bat, but imagine it from Aubrey‚Äôs perspective. Your former friend is standing there, looking at you approaching him with a nailed bat. But even then, I feel like Aubrey has a sense of hesitation, just for like a second, because this is her friend that she hasn‚Äôt seen in a long time. Even in her plunge into rage, she has a tiny voice that tells her to stop. But, all of a sudden, Sunny slices her with a knife. Aubrey is taken aback, not only by the suddenness of the attack‚Ä¶but by the sheer coldness and unhesitating nature of the attack. She cared at least a bit for Sunny‚Ä¶yet he showed her none of that. She‚Äôs confused‚Ä¶so she falls back into rage. \n\n\nLike I said, you don‚Äôt have to like her, but I do want to preface that you should understand her actions. Whilst they‚Äôre not good actions at all, and she‚Äôs very much in the wrong, I believe it‚Äôs important to understand why. It‚Äôs not the most perfect analysis for her, but I encourage you to look at it from her perspective and understand why she does what she does. Not saying that you don‚Äôt already, but just making sure you know how important it is.",

        "body": "She's literally a 16 year old girl you can't expect her to act fully maturely and in consideration of everyone else. Like most of us at that age she's overly focused on her own problems and feelings.\n\n>Saying she got abandoned when everyone else was just trying to cope\n\nI mean she did get abandoned. All her friends left, her father left, and her Mom might as well have left. Sunny had his Mom enabling his lifestyle and even Kel constantly trying to reach him. Aubrey would have died if she became a shut-in. \n\n>-Acting as if she was the only one who felt sad about Mari's passing\n\nFrom her perspective Basil destroyed the photos, Kel is all cherry and happy, Sunny keeps to himself, and Hero went full overachiever and neglected them. She's the only one who actually visits Mari's grave as well. Obviously we know the full context but Aubrey of course would not. \n\n>-Bullying Basil for god knows how long, definitely a contributing factor to his suicide\n\nShe doesn't consider Basil until it's too late. While the bullying was bad and didn't help Basil's suicide is clearly about his guilt and his delusion since Mari's death, Sunny leaving, and most likely that his Grandma might have died too. Take away Aubrey's bullying and he still would do the same thing. Basil is not living in reality anymore. As well that isn't the canon ending just a possibility if Sunny doesn't confront the truth with Basil. \n\n>-Getting mad at Kel and Sunny for leaving with Basil after she literally nearly killed two of them\n\nThat scene was to show a parallel to what Sunny did. Neither of them died and she feels guilty right away and locks herself up the next day. She doesn't want them to leave because she doesn't want to be seen as a monsyer. \n\n>-Saying she's not the bully but if they want her to she'll be one\n\nFrom her perspective Basil destroyed the memories of someone important to her who died. He might as well smashed Mari's headstone. Then Kel who seems to not even care about Mari's death and Sunny who disappeared for years start following her around town bad-mouthing her and harassing her and she can't even go to Church without being attacked by the whole congregation anymore. \n\n>-Refusing to explain why she bullied Basil [wasn't even his fault] until one day left\n\nThat's more so Hero and his approach rather than the time limit. He actually approached her and asked for her side. Kel would escalate and accuse which obviously just made her defensive and uncooperative. Neither Kel or Aubrey are mature enough to work things out on their own. \n\n>-Getting mad at Sunny for having a knife after she tried to beat him with a nailed bat\n\nConsider this. Aubrey attacks with the bat and it does minor damage iirc it's about the same damage Kel does. Sunny attacks with a knife and Aubrey instantly goes down, could have died, and Kel confiscates the knife. Everyone around town reacts negatively to the knife but not to the bat. Obviously a bat irl would be a dangerous weapon (still not as much as a knife though) but from the context either Aubrey is not swinging at full force and using it more to deal with/create the distance or the bat isn't that deadly in universe. \n\n\nI'm also fairly certain that she apologizes if you do the extra scenes/activities.",

Her father left at a Young age and her mom is clearly an alcoholic who doesn‚Äôt care for her, something which she is aware of and insecure about, seeing as how she never invited her friends to her house. A troubled childhood mixed with the suicide of a close friend is more than enough to push a person over the edge. Her lashing out at  the others obviously comes from her own insecurities. I think shes a very 3 dimensional character with lots of depth, and i really enjoyed her character development, as well as the stark contrast between the headspace version and the Faraway version. Sure, she isn‚Äôt exactly a very Nice person for most of the game, but thats not the same as her not being a good, well-written character. Everyone has a reason for turning out the way they turn out.",

    "selftext": "okay, i don't actually hate the song that much. i think it's perfectly serviceable and suits the battle well. but i am really tired of people just glazing this song and treating it as the best in the soundtrack when there are way better and more interesting songs imo. i think this song's popularity is for two different reasons:  \n1. this song, along with the other boss and battle themes, overshadows the ambient tracks since you're not supposed to really listen to something like 56-12-2 on your own time  \n2. ~~sweetheart is the only good boss fight in the entire game~~\n\nnow that you've fallen for my semi-sincere ragebait, i'm going to yap about my favorite songs in the omori soundtrack\n\nwhite surf style 6:  \ni'm inherently biased towards this track, because this is actually what introduced me to omori! i saw a super cool animation on youtube called \"frosting with no cake\", and it had this as the background music. i loved it, so i decided to take a listen, and now this game has inflicted permanent brain damage on me. actually, fuck it, i even made a siivagunner rip-like remix where this song was the joke. i love this song, it's beautiful, it has really awesome glissandos/grace notes, and the harmonica just goes hard.\n\nswirly 1000x:  \nthis song not only sounds good, but it's also unique and has an awesome & fitting vibe to it. it sounds like something the hooligans would actually play. it feels very improvised and messy, in a good way! it reminds me of eyes of flame from the cave story soundtrack, specifically the remastered version. overall, awesome song.\n\ndear little brother...:  \nthis is a fucking awesome reprise of by your side. this scene was absolutely incredible, it's so simple yet so effective, just like this song. it's calming, yet apprehensive.\n\nforest frenzy:  \nthis song feels like the layer 3 soundtrack from eversion. i love these moments in video games where you're starting to feel a little bit scared or sad and you know things are gonna get worse, but for now, you're still vibing. mainly because these parts tend to have AWESOME soundtracks, and forest frenzy is a good example of this! it's still very happy and upbeat, but it doesn't have that same childlike flair that tussle among trees and three bar logos have. you're back in headspace, but you haven't forgotten what you saw in the real world. \n\nyou cannot go back:  \nthis song is brilliant. it feels icy in all the worst ways, and it's super eerie because of that. space ex-husband has some chilling parallels to sunny - after a tragedy, both of these characters have decided to stop interacting with society and attempt to suppress their emotions. perhaps all the leitmotifs in the song could be space ex-husband escaping to his own dream world, only choosing to live the good parts of his memories. \n\ngrimey:  \nthis song is great. it's very atmospheric and fitting for humphrey, being gross and fleshy while also having sounds of machinery. the kick-bass really adds to the uncomfortable atmosphere of the song, and lets you know that you are fighting enemies in the stomach of a whale. the percussion is absolutely incredible, and the sound design is killer! it feels like a rather low-stakes and unimportant song that just so happened to be done PERFECTLY, and i love it for that.\n\nunderwater prom queens:   \nthis song is sick. everything about is pure awesomeness. the bass is great, the instrument choices work well, the composition is incredibly effective, the first section has some amazing bass (which i believe is actually a motif used in an earlier song?) and amen chopping, before transitioning into a heavenly chord progression with a beautiful xylophone in the background while the percussion's tone gets completely changed. then, the song starts switching between the two tones of these sections rapidly, the first going crazy with the orchestral hits while having the choir-like instrument act as a sort of siren (perhaps to symbolize that humphrey is getting hungrier), and the second having some insane percussion. then, there's a small break that builds up to the last, iconic part. i don't like it as much as others do, but i still think it's peak. the extremely fast bassline and beautiful arpeggios really make the section feel climactic as it should\n\nsinking:  \nok, so in case you didn't know. i kinda like the soundtrack of deep well. y'know, just a little bit. anyways, i think sinking is the best song in omori. the intro could be classified as a jumpscare with how abrupt it is, but i love it because of that. the song is hauntingly beautiful, with an incredible chord progression that works with the amazing sound design to really get across this feeling of desperation. the song feels like it's crying. the song feels like it's barely holding itself together and is ready to snap at any second now. the song feels like it's... alive. i'd argue that it's more emotional than final duet and good morning, because of just how effective this song is.",

        "body": "You know, there are moments in life that just stick with you. Memories that weave themselves into the very fabric of your existence, shaping who you are, and making you question the nature of reality itself. One of those moments for me was the enigmatic phenomenon called r/place.\n\nPicture this: a virtual canvas, an infinite expanse of digital space where people from all corners of the internet converged. They could place a single pixel of any color on this canvas every few minutes. It was chaotic, yet strangely harmonious, as art and anarchy danced a bewildering tango. Can you dig it?\n\nEvery pixel became a battle, an expression of individuality clashing with the collective will. It was a microcosm of life, man! We were all artists, contributing to this chaotic masterpiece, and our creations would live on as long as the canvas remained. How often do you get to experience something so transient, yet so eternal?\n\nAnd amidst the pixelated chaos, bonds formed. Communities united under their banners, rallying together to protect their creations from the pixel-pushers, vandals, and entropy itself. They called it the \"Blue Corner,\" the \"Rainbow Road,\" and so many other names. It was like witnessing the rise and fall of empires in real-time, man.\n\nAs for me, I found myself drawn into this swirling vortex of creativity and passion. I embraced my pixelated destiny, contributing to the ever-evolving tapestry with my humble strokes. Sometimes it was a cat, sometimes a UFO, or even an obscure reference to a forgotten meme. Each pixel was like a piece of my soul laid bare for all to see.\n\nBut as the days went by, something peculiar happened. r/place ended, and all the masterpieces vanished, reduced to mere memories. And yet, those memories stayed with us. The connections we made, the shared experiences, the ephemeral art that touched us at our core ‚Äì it was all real, even if it only existed for a brief moment.\n\nLife is like that, you know? Fleeting, transient, but full of beauty and meaning. We create, we love, we cherish, and eventually, it all fades away. But what we leave behind, the mark we make on this vast canvas of existence, that's what truly matters.\n\nr/place may be gone, but the spirit of it lives on in each one of us who participated. It reminds me to cherish every pixel of my existence, to embrace the chaos, and to savor those fleeting moments that shape who we are.\n\nSo, dear, let us celebrate the enigma that was r/place, and let it serve as a reminder to immerse ourselves in the canvas of life, daring to leave our mark, no matter how transient it may be. Because in the end, it's all about the journey, the connections, and the art we create along the way. Keep painting your masterpiece, my friend, one pixel at a time.",

He ONLY reaches out to Sunny when he finds out Sunny is moving.\n\n\"KEL has been trying really hard to get a hold of you ever since we put our house up for sale. He's been calling us every week for the past few months!\"\n\nNot \"since you've stopped going out\", it's \"since we put our house up\". He only does things when it's close to the point of no return. We also know he hasn't been talking to Basil and Aubrey since he knows jack about the album, and Aubrey saying she's been abandoned by everyone.\n\nIdk, I feel like Kel should've done more. If he did, maybe Basil wouldn't be close to suicide by that point in the game and maybe everyone would be less... distant from each other.",

It is because that's the point. All of these reasons are actually entirely removed from nuance and don't acknowledge why things turned out the way they did. Finding a \"most at fault\" in a game like omori misses the point by a long shot.\n\nHowever, Kel literally did nothing to fault in terms of contributing to the situation. He had every right to act out in the way every other characters did. He could've become violent like aubrey. Obsessive like basil. Or avoidant like hero. But he doesn't. He goes down the literally least outwardly harmful path and tries to keep living. He clearly sticks up for Basil and even comes back for sunny.\n\nI don't know if this is rage bait or just you trying to be contrarian, but even if we were doing this, Kel would be the last one to point fingers at for the friend group falling apart.",

        "body": "Best tip i could give: Observe her instantly, if she targets 4 people you basicslly won: You just broke her AI so she will only have 1 phase and her attacks are predictable (Each turns, the damage will be as following: Max HP x .75 => Just fully heal the party with Aubrey with Pizza/Chicken and make sure Hero use that one item where Snacks heal more!)\n\nHere is my turns on Perfectheart:\nTurn 1: Setup everything, early nuke (Coffee lasts 6 turns), debuffs, however you call it. Don't give anyone emotions, make sure Perfectheart is slower than Omori. Mesmerize is always nice just in case she steals Kel's energy.\n\nTurn 2: Observe, next turn (sometimes 2 more turns) will broke her AI so this turn, make sure Aubrey/Hero patches up everyone, MoreInfo mod would be helpful to track foes's speed. Kel should release no-advantage nuke by this point to deal some damage since she won't heal anyway!\n\nTurn 3: If her AI is still not broken, Observe again. Kel should give Omori coffee for Vertigo nuke (i don't know if Omori or Kel moves first if they have the same speed), do another Mesmerize just in case and Aubrey heals.\n\nTurn 4: Don't give her emotions, that's all. Do whatever you want, make sure Aubrey/Hero heals and give everyone happy (They have to do both jobs at one turn, not 2 people 1 job) and make everyone Happy (unless all 4 of them are already Happy) after Perfectheart attacks because of Kel/Omori nuke utilizes Speed for damage (you will only have 2 people to set up nuke, it's fine).\n\nTurn 5: lol did she die yet? Repeat turn 4 if she doesn't. \n\n\nManaged to get a 6 turns PR, no RNG mods with this strategy! (albeit a bit of RNG.)\n\nQuite literally the easiest way yet to beat Perfectheart imo, easy to perform and inexpensive (Kill chickens/Squizzards for clams. Bossman Hero deal if you have access to console version) and short turns.",

I will start by saying that both of you have demonstrated impressive combat ability.\"\n\nShe turned to Hero.\n\"Hero, you have proven yourself to be a formidable warrior with or without your sword. You're fast, resilient, and can easily turn the tide to our favor with your 'Channel Emotion' Skill. Your only major downside is that you're‚Ä¶\"\n\nHero shyly finished her sentence.\n\"...weak?\"\n\nPandora blushed and shook her head.\n\"No! Just...not quite as strong as the rest of us when it comes to Attack Power. Were you holding back your strength against Karasu?\"\n\nHe shook his head, his face kinda serious for some reason that I didn't get at the time.\n\"Nope. I Invested in mostly fortifying my Defense. So my Power suffered...alot.\"\n\nPandora tilted her head a little, showin' to him that she was completely lost on what he meant.\n\"...'Invest'? How does one‚Ä¶'Invest' in Defense?\"\n\nSentri, who was tired as Hell from her fight with Omu, yawned and quietly backed my gal pal up.\n\"Indeed. I would...like to Invest‚Ä¶ in Defense as well. I am quite frail without my Clay Clothing.\"\n\nHero patted her on the head.\n\"Hold your horses, guys. I need to explain what 'Investing' means. It's basically the way 'Physical' people like me get stronger. By exercising or resting after a tough fight, we can choose to boost one of our Stats. It's why Kel is such a beefy tank.\"\n\nI patted my chest for emphasis.\n\"Yup. All Defense, baby!\"\n\nPandora looked at us like she was shocked at her ignorance...even though she shouldn't be, if you ask me.\n\"Well...that makes sense. I did find it...peculiar that you were so much tougher than your counterpart.\"\n\nSentri puffed up her cheeks and made a poutin' face.\n\"So we Tulpas can only gain strength by defeating strong enemies, correct?\"\n\nHero nodded but wrapped his arm 'round her neck.\n\"Yeah. Your bodies work differently than ours since it's basically 100% Juice.\"\n\nSentri folded her arms and turned her nose up at him.\n\" 'Balderdash' is what I say to that.\"\n\nHero shrugged and chuckled a little.\n\"Sorry, Sentri. That's just how it is.\"\n\nSentri wasn't vibin' with that at all, but since she respects my bro a lot, she just decided to stay quiet and pout some more.\n\nWith that side-topic settled, Pandora kept goin'\n\"Thank you for the explanation, Hero. Now, I cast my vote in favor of you becoming a Team Member. Everyone, what is your decision?\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, none of us objected to Hero joinin' us. Even Karasu was for it...which shocked me, 'cuz I was thinkin' he would vote against my bro outta spite.\n\nCLEAR: You clearly didn't think very highly of 'em after he almost killed Hero.\n\n(Kelsey nodded his head as a very hard expression emerged.)\n\nKELSEY: I sure didn't. I was hidin' it, but I was freakin' pissed at Karasu for goin' after my bro like that. I didn't want him on our Team anymore at that point, but I wanted Omu to stick 'round. He was a cool little dude and he was one of our best Team Members even back then.\n\nSo I held my tongue...till we got to Sentri.\n\n\"Sentri,\" Pandora started, lookin' her dead in the eye. \"I am somewhat...unsure about you. You have a formidable amount of Power and your Skills are very potent, but you seem to be easily distracted and reckless with your Juice usage. Additionally, I do not know anything about you beyond your friendship with Hero. For those reasons, I must Vote against you being a part of our Team for the time being.\"\n\nSentri frowned, but she took it really well for a kid.\n\"That is a fair assessment‚Ä¶\"\n\nPandora didn't want to hurt her feelings, so she added,\n\"But I can only cast one Vote. You still have a chance to join us, Sentri.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I added, \"and I think you should be one of us. All the problems she said could be fixed with time. Shoot, you can tell us more about yourself after this Voting stuff is done.\"\n\nOmori looked at Pandora before turning to Sentri and sayin',\n\"No. I don't think you should join us. My‚Ä¶.Sister is correct.\"\n\nI stopped smilin' 'cuz I felt like the dude was only sayin' that to agree with Pandora. His tone didn't sound honest to me.\n\nBut I wasn't goin' to brow-beat Omori for that. He's still lickin' the wounds he got from hurtin' her.\n\nSunny surprised me by actually sayin',\n\"She should join us. We need the manpower.\"\n\nKarasu scowled and shook his head.\n\"No we don't. She's more of a liability if anything. What if she accidentally kills one of us with her asinine AOE Skills?\"\n\nSentri scowled at him‚Äînot that I blame her. He was pissin' me off, too.\n\"I will do no such thing. I will listen to Hero and Omu's advice and use my Skills more carefully.\"\n\nThe guy looked at Omu, who was lookin' really uncomfortable.\n\"Brother, you'll vouch for me, right?\"\n\nThe little dude shuffled and looked at the ground.\n\"Um...actually...I...I want Sentri...on the Team‚Ä¶\"\n\nKarasu was stunned. I guess he never expected that his loyal little bro would go against him like that.\n\"...Omu...why?\"\n\nOmu twiddled his thumbs as he explained himself.\n\"Because...I...I want to be her friend. I like her‚Ä¶\"\n\nSentri's glarin' turned into the sweetest little smile I've ever seen in my life.\n\"Omu, I want to be your friend as well!\"\n\nKarasu grimaced like he was hit in the gut.\n\"That...that isn't a valid reason to have her on the Team, Omu. Just because you want to be her friend doesn't mean she would be a good Team Member.\"\n\nThis was the part where I couldn't take it anymore. Even though he got a good point, I wanted to let how I felt about him be known.\n\"Dude, you're not a good Member of the Team!\"\n\nKarasu reared his head back.\n\"How dare you say that, Kelsey! I am a valuable asset to the Team. I even directly helped defeat several of our enemies!\"\n\nI got up and started to scream my lungs out.\n\"Yeah, but you almost killed my brother!! You're a freakin' fruitcake!!!\"\n\nKarasu looked kinda...hurt that I said that. Which surprised the Hell outta me, 'cuz I thought what I said didn't matter to him at all.\n\nHe looked at the rest of Team Faraway for support.\n\"You...you all don't believe that I'm crazy, do you?\"\n\nPandora shook her head, but her expression was pretty hard and unforgivin'.\n\"No, I do not. But what you almost did to Hero is indefensible. In fact, I think I can speak for nearly everyone that if it wasn't for the current circumstances, you wouldn't be on our Team any longer.\"\n\nKarasu sucked in his breath.\n\"You...you promised you wouldn't talk to me like that.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Karasu, but I must break my promise in this instance. What you did...was too much for me to sugarcoat.\"\n\nThe dude looked at Omori to see if he'll come to his defense.\nBut even the pale little guy just frowned at him and turned away.\n\nBesides Omu and Hero, no one was on his corner at this point, which made him look sad for a minute.\n\nHero tried to grab his shoulder, but he charged it with Electricity, makin' my bro flinch a little.\n\"Back off,\" he spat at 'em. \"I don't need your sympathy. I don't need anything from you fools. As soon as Boss is dealt with, you won't see my brother and I ever again.\"\n\nOmu started cryin'. Sentri wrapped her arm 'round him and brought him close.\n\nI felt like shit for startin' all this drama. I shoulda talked to Karasu one on one instead of ropin' everyone in with this.\n\nCLEAR: Honestly, Joe...this Day felt like several cramped into one.\n\nKELSEY: I know, right? Out of all the 'War Days', this one was the most exhaustin', both physically and emotionally.\n\nPandora lets everyone‚Ä¶ 'recover', I guess before she went back to business.\n\"Alright...let us tally the votes‚Ä¶\"\n\nThe Votes were three in favor for Sentri joinin' the Team, while three were against her.\n\nThere needed to be a tiebreaker, and I knew just the thing.\n\"How 'bout Rock-Paper-Scissors, guys? Whoever wins gets to decide whether Sentri goes on the Team or not.\"\n\nEveryone was on board with that, so all that's left was to see who would be the two volunteers.\n\nWhen it came down to it, Sunny and Pandora were the ones who participated.\n\nCLEAR: Why didn't you get in on it? Were you too bummed out to participate?\n\nKELSEY: Not really. I love games like RPS, but I freakin' suck at 'em. I'm way too predictable.\n\nLuckily, Sunny was more of a wild card, so he was able to beat Pandora with no problems.\n\n\"Well,\" she said casually, \"looks like Sentri will be able to join us after all.\"\n\nSentri jumped to her feet and hugged Hero.\n\"Yes! Sentri and Hero join the party!\"\n\nI really wanted to join in on her enthusiasm, but I wasn't really in the mood.\n\nStill, it was cute and made most of us smile. Omu was obviously the most happy 'bout this.\n\nWith the Votin' outta the way, Omori was ready for action.\n\"When will we begin our siege?\" he asked Pandora.\n\nShe looked at Sentri in a really suspicious way.\n\"Sentri, how did you and Hero meet? I am usually familiar with most Tulpas originating from Sunny's Headspace. But you...you are completely foreign to me.\"\n\nSentri looked at my bro for help.\n\"Hero, may I tell them? \"\n\n\"Sure!\" Hero said with a wink. \"We'll tell them together.\"\n\nShe smiled and quickly began her Tale.\n\"Very well! I shall begin at the time of my Creation. I awoke to--\"\n\nHero grabbed her hand, stoppin' her dead in her tracks.\n\n\"Um...Sentri...let me start things off, okay? I'll tell you when you can join in.\"\n\nShe made a pouting face but she didn't argue.\n\"Hmph! So be it. I will tell them of my Creation some other time.\"\n\nThat was a little disappointin', 'cuz I was legitimately interested in knowin' how Meido and her posse \"made\" her. \n\nBut it was no biggie. What Hero ended up tellin' us was just as good.",

I was on board with everything up until they hung her corpse to stage it as a suicide üò≠. First of all, her dying from just falling down the stairs is pretty unlikely, but it‚Äôs still possible and fine. But there was absolutely no reason for them to stage it as a suicide. That made what Sunny and Basil did WAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY worse, because before that it was a heat-of-the-moment accident, and the guilt of them knowing it was Sunny who pushed her I think is enough to traumatize them and incite their downward spirals. But they really did not have to fake a suicide that was ridiculous. It‚Äôs crazy a 12 year old thought of that, it‚Äôs crazy a 12 year old managed to hang her corpse from a tree with no help, and it was completely unnecessary because they could have just said she tripped. I know the other characters wouldn‚Äôt have been hit as hard if they didn‚Äôt think she killed herself, but there HAS to be a better way to make that misunderstanding happen. Shit was comical. I did like the detail that the parents knew Sunny did it, but helped cover it up so they wouldn‚Äôt lose him.",

That the whole thing was a way to give vague ends where you don't have to go into detail about the endings. Like the game was up until that point about suicide and learning to move on from the trauma then suddenly we learn no Mari's death wasn't a tragic suicide it was an accident that went from 0 to 100 to the moon in no time. Why did the first thing basil think of was suicide and how did they get away with it? The parents knew so why not the police or the person who did the autopsy? Why weren't either boy forced into therapy or juvie. It's sorta like somewhere near the end point their needed to be a reason to fight omori or stranger so the game went with no its not guilt in not helping your sister so you feel like you killed her its you literally murdered you sister and staged it as suicide because you couldn't just talk to her or your friends and family.",

An understaffed police department presented with an apparently open-and-shut case of suicide (a brief query would have shown Mari was an ambitious kid with a lot of pressure on her and known perfectionist tendencies) isn't going to spend money on an autopsy if nobody's raising a stink to do so.\n\n>The parents knew \n\nWe don't actually know that. The Black Space scene with the father may not have been a memory, but a metaphor.\n\nOr he may have suspected, but was alone in doing so.\n\nOr Mari may have been his favorite kid, and losing her made him lash out at Sunny for unrelated reasons.\n\nAbd this isn't even getting into what the mother did or didn't know, which is barely even hinted at.\n\n>its not guilt in not helping your sister so you feel like you killed her its you literally murdered you sister\n\nYes. And there's nothing wrong with that being the theme of the story: there are plenty of stories about perceived guilt after a loved one commits suicide.\n\nOMORI just happens to be a story about how you come to terms with the guilt of *actually* being responsible for the death of someone you love more than anyone else.\n\nIt's a less likely situation to occur in real life, but it's not an inherently worse theme because of it.",

With Basil's decision, he was 12 years old and in a panic. he needed a way for Sunny and himself to seem innocent, he didn't make the right decision but it isn't unrealistic. a theory that makes a lot of sense is that the parents knew the truth. The only time when we see Sunny's dad in a hole, he says \"stay away, you are not my son\" this makes sense if his dad knew about everything and hated Sunny for it and therefore left. It seems very obvious that she didn't die from suicide, so if the parents knew and didn't want Sunny to go to juvie/jail, they could not have done an autopsy.",

It feels a bit too far fetched and frankly contrived. Two young kids decide to frame the accidental murder of someone they both admired? Borderline psychotic, and yes I know that it has happened irl but it‚Äôs extremely rare, especially for children. \n\nWhat‚Äôs wrong with just suicide? \n\nWhy not have Sunny wake up one day trying to find his lovely, kind and beautiful sister only to discover her hanging body outside. It would kill him just as much as framing her death. It‚Äôs also more realistic, suicide is quite common and with all the stresses Mari had it would have pushed her over the edge (haha get it). \n\nIt would have destroyed the friend group and the family aswell and would hurt Sunny with trying to figure out why she did it. The families of suicide victims always blame themselves and it would have been a good story arc for Mari to eventually forgive Sunny, and to move on. \n\nIt also fits with her constant caring and happy behaviour, since most suicide victims usually put on a mask of happiness. It would‚Äôve also been more relatable to a lot of the audience instead of framing a murder.\n\nI think it would have been an easier plot point while being just as impactful or maybe not idk.

        "body": "---Why the truth hurt Sunny so much\n\nSo yes, the trauma part is important, but it's not the whole story.\n\nPrior to Mari's death, Sunny was already insecure and dealt feelings of inadequacy and already feeling like a burden to the friend group prior to this. He is the one who killed Mari, and additionally Basil taking the role of protecting him and helping frame her death, just made this already existing insecurity a thousand times worse.\n\nCombine this with the fact that Something and other ways his trauma and guilt manifested would taunt him and reminded him constantly of his failure to stop Mari from killing herself pre-truth, and then reminding him of his actual murder of her post-truth, this is what broke Sunny and led to him contemplating suicide. \n\nHe felt like he had taken too much and never given back, and as a result, felt extremely guilty, and like nothing but a parasite and a burden, who's friends loved the supposed mask he put on and not him, because he believed he was intrinsically unlovable.\n\nThis is why Mari's death, and specifically, his role in it, affected him so severely. \n\n\n---My analysis\n\nWhat I believe happened from my own personal analysis, Sunny had struggled with minor depression (dysthymia) prior to Mari's death and fought it throughout his pre-teen years, which is why you never really saw him smile much and not really react much to things even before he was broken by Mari dying (Source: I have had dysthymia since 7). Mari's death and his repressed trauma compounded this and created a thing known as 'double depression', which is when dysthymia and major depressive disorder basically stack on top of each other. And basically left him completely unable to take care of himself properly, or even leave his house to go to school, him being unable to help out around the house, and leaving Basil behind when he needed him most, which mind you, wasn't his fault, he was too drained to even move most days, led to Sunny's decline mentally and when the truth finally came out, everything fell apart. \n\nThis is why the bad ending is my personal headcanon ending. You don't go through all that and make it out with zero support from anyone else.",

I don't love everything about Omori big reveal because I had thought the whole twist about Sunny pushing Mari and later Sunny and Basil staging her body as a suicide was frankly shock value and macabre. Removing what could have been a good message about grief and grief alone, changing people in different ways, and how we learn to overcome it. \n\nThat being said, it was necessary for the story. Besides, there being hints alluding to it throughout the game that would go nowhere without it. Basil and Sunny arc would be less interesting without that tramua bond that justify some of their weird behavior in the story. They would need a new connection of sorts to also make up for the third act as without it, the finale would be weaker. \n\nThe finale actually really ties up everything well that even if you disagree with the twist on a surface level.

        "body": "You might be missing the forest for the trees a little bit here. I don't think you realize that the Mari we see in most of the game isn't exactly what she was like when she was alive. She's been dead for four years, and it gets harder to keep an accurate memory of someone the longer time goes on. That, and people tend to frame their dead loved ones in the best possible light.\n\nMari, mind both Sunny's mind after her death and in their parents minds when she was alive, is never allowed to be anything but perfect. Even when she was alive, sunny was so young that he probably wouldve seen her as perfect anyway, especially since he's the younger sibling. If you want to look below the surface, that's partly why she's still in her uniform and never leaves the blanket. She's always exactly where she needs to be so she can stay in the same, perfect state and so sunny can immediately find her when he needs to (that, and she has a bad knee, so sunny doesn't want her running around and getting hurt). She's not necessarily the one wearing that mask. It was forced upon her in people's minds, even moreso after she died. As time goes on, and we start to uncover the truth, Mari becomes less of that perfect image. \n\nYou also need to realize that the ENTIRE point of Omori existing is to protect sunny from the truth. The moment we find out she \"killed herself,\" that bubble should've been popped. It's much easier to deal with something like that than it is to deal with the thought that you are responsible. With a suicide, you don't have to take the blame. You didn't tie the noose, pull the trigger, give them the pills, etc. He murdered her. He pushed her, and she died. There's no avoiding responsibility for that, and he was only 12 at the time. That's a LOT to deal with at any age, let alone being a pubescent child. \n\nIf you look even deeper, Mari's imperfections are given a new form in headspace, in a way. Sweetheart and space boyfriend's relationship can be seen as somewhat similar to hero and Mari's. Especially when you take into account that space captain and hero put mari and sweetheart up on that pedestal, and Mari and sweetheart like to tease those two. Mari is a bit mischievous. She has played several pranks on Hero. She seems to like messing with him. All in all, the Mark that we usually see in headspace is only a small fraction of what she's actually like. \n\nIt's true that Mari was a perfectionist, but far from perfect. She was clearly rubbing off on sunny and pushing him past his limits, which ultimately led to that fight. He just wanted to spend time with his sister again, but the pressure got the best of her, and she transferred some of that to him. Their parents also clearly suck, and this could've been avoided if they didn't suck so bad. With the way things were going, you're right about the likelihood of Mari killing herself.\n\nYou're also missing the point of the plot with basil. Most of it wouldn't make sense without that shade trauma. Sunny feels double guilty for constantly needing to be protected by everyone around him, and killing the main person who always protected him. He then faces the risk of losing the person who protected him from facing an even bigger trauma by being arrested and going to prison. Sunny likely would've killed himself already if not for basil. It just doesn't make sense, plot-wise, for them to not stage that suicide.",

This is specifically targeted towards people who are fully capable of paying for the manga and choose not to.*\n\nSo today the 4th chapter of the Omori manga came out, and as many people have found out, it costs money. $2 for this chapter, and likely the next chapters going forward. While this is unfortunate for fans who cannot pay, this is actually very common practice in the manga industry-- it's no different to getting a free trial to a service or a demo to a video game. While it'd be nice if the manga was free, it ultimately costs the creator money to produce, and they've got to make that money back somewhere.\n\nWith that being said, people on this subreddit are going absolutely wild posting pirated copies of the manga, either through DMs, in Google Documents, or directly onto the subreddit. A lot of people are claiming that since the manga is subjectively bad, that they don't find it worth it to spend money on it. While I haven't had the chance to read the manga to see **how \"garbage\" it is, it literally doesn't fucking matter.** Piracy is piracy, and whether like what you're pirating doesn't make it any more right or wrong.\n\nEven is an indie creator, I believe piracy to be a good thing. It gives people access to material that would otherwise be inaccessible to them (such as minors, people who physically don't have the money, etc.). It also pushes large AAA game companies to improve. With that being said, **pirates should still make a concerted effort to support the games they enjoy, which I do not see in this community at all.** Unless you're under some extenuating circumstance (not liking the manga does not count), you're essentially freeloading off an indie developer who's just trying to make their community happy, which is seriously fucked up.\n\nI'm not even saying don't pirate the manga-- as I said, many people have reasons they simply cannot pay or access content like this. However, I know for damn sure that's not all of you here. And **if you're pirating the manga for no reason other than \"it's not a good manga,\" you seriously cannot sit here and call yourself an Omori fan.**",

    "selftext": "Soo...  \nDoes anyone else sometimes unironically think \"man... i wish all that stuff in OMORI‚Ñ¢ was real and actually happened just so that i could.... come and comfort Sunny (and Basil)...?\"  \nI mean... That's kinda weird since it OBVIOUSLY isn't the case and will never be. I'm feeling overly sympathetic towards a goddamn drawing (even if it's a well-made drawing). Is it simply a result of the nature of the game? Does it maybe say something deeper about my personality?... But I don't usually consider myself \"kind and supportive\", in fact I'm used to seeing myself as rather selfish...\n\nBut on the other side... Who knows what his reaction would be?? Maybe he'd go full psychopath mode and stab me? Maybe he'd just find it weird? I really don't interact with people IRL often, so I'm not even confident in my ability to, well, help people like that emotionally... How would I even approach it? Give him a good old hug? I'm really not used to doing that... Just saying \"hey man it's all gonna be fine dw about it\" would sound dismissive, like I don't actually care...\n\nI probably need to clarify:  \nI definitely do NOT wish somebody had to actually go through all the trauma in order for me to come and be the \"hero\". I just feel like OMORI awakened something special deep within my heart that made me feel more sympathetic...? It hasn't been long yet so I'm not sure if these newfound feelings even apply to real people around me or if I somehow feel closer to fictional characters than to a friend who I literally share a desk with, which would definitely be a weird trait .\\_.\n\nSo the question is, is this a me-thing or an OMORI-thing?",

I haven't looked up if there's any for Omori, but I'd be surprised it there wasn't because it's such a popular game. Might be up your alley. It won't be a self insert, but people project onto characters all the time. Or you could write your own if you wanted. :)",

        "body": "honestly I feel the same way. Not really about Sunny, since I see myself too much in him, but more about Basil. I just can't stop thinking about how much he had suffered and that he literally never gets a hug in game. It makes me so sad :( Hopefully he will be able to move on post truth with Sunny's help (even if from another town) and probably Polly's too. I'm sure Kel and eventually the others would give him some support too, maybe at first they'd be distant for the truth thing but I don't think they'd leave him, especially in such a delicate moment. \nSo more than \"I wish I was there to comfort him\" I feel \"I wish he will get comfort\". I think this Is what the game wants us to feel after all, It's a really tragic story that puts very young and unfortunate kids under a lot of trauma. So I think it's normal, unless we're both just mentally ill and can't separate fiction from reality lmao.",

Obviously it‚Äôs a story and there‚Äôs some intense parts, but it‚Äôs still realistic enough that it‚Äôs easy to connect to.\n\nI will say, headspace is very intriguing because when people experience trauma, a lot of the time you have your surface level thoughts and the repressed ones you try to ignore. The always come out though, even if it‚Äôs in the way you talk to yourself, others, or how your brain basically rewires itself in a constant flight or fight (or freeze) response.\n\nAll in all, it was handled very well, perhaps exceptionally well.

The fact he just smiles after waking up kinda makes me go in that direction, you'd probably realize after coming to your senses that you permanently injured your best friend? It gets even sadder if you think of the \"fight\" as Sunny trying to restrain Basil and calm him down, but then Basil restrains him to stab his eye, it just paints Sunny as a poor child that suffered all the brunt of Basil's insanity while he was trying to stop it... about Basil's own injuries, i believe Sunny didn't do them (he had no reason to) and they happened on accident from waving damn garden shears around, even so Basil will probably heal, i dont think he has much more than a few cuts and maybe a stab, while Sunny is permanently injured and lost half his vision. I like Basil, he's really cute, and i like that they forgave eachother at the end for Mari, but damn, how Basil gets away with stabbing Sunny's eye out will always make me feel uncomfortable",

Maybe they smiled because they got to move on from the worry of getting hated, from the guilt that burdens them for so long, I do not believe Basil would smile if the trios just cut off contact (Or Aubrey brutalizes him more!).  \n\n\nOR  \n\n\nSunny accepts the \"punishment\" yet again for the accidental murder, this is evident by the fact that his body is heavily mutilated when finding out the truth, whatever apology Basil says might just fall on deaf ears. Perhaps the smile was to indicate that they will still be best friends even after 4 years of hell, even after taking away his bestie's eye. In case of the trios take the truth the worst, they would be companionship together, and they will not leave each other behind again. Sure as hell none of the two boys would want to be alone, knowing that the other 3 may never contact them again, having a formerly partner-in-crime would not hurt... right?\n\n~~Maybe One-eyed Sunny looks really cute thoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo would hug~~\n\n~~Omocat intentionally made this part cryptic to make money~~",

In the first fight in the playground against boss, he gets captured and doesn't do shit. He just sits there like \"waaaa help me\" like he doesn't even try to fight for himself. When he gets bullied by Aubrey in the real world he just stands there. He lets it happen, and he lets him getting pushed into the lake happen.\n\nBasil is an idiot. When him and sunny frame mari's death as a suicide they're like 13. You'd think he'd be logical and have sunny come clean about framing her death- but idk. \n\nAlso there's the flower garden scene where basil is showing off his plants and being like \"bla bla bla kel is a cactus\"\nWell sunnys a freaking tulip ig and basils all like \"sunny is a tulip because he's bland\" and playing through that scene I was like \"yo wtf\", it was so mean and just- ugh idk.\n\nin conclusion Basil is a dumb little crybaby who's also really mean and stupid",

    "selftext": "This might be an odd take, but am I the only one who feels like some comments in the community rub off that way? \n\nI mainly see this in reference to Basil but sometimes Sunny too. I think it‚Äôs understandable why people might be split on those characters and might not like them (and they‚Äôre entitled to that opinion) but some of the things said about them concerning their mental health problems is incredibly gross. \n\nLike watering down Faraway!Basil to an ‚ÄúUwU smol soft boi‚Äù, or his obsessiveness over Sunny to being a ‚Äúyandere.‚Äù I personally find that off-putting, but I can pass that off as a joke.\n\nWhat I can‚Äôt really see as being passed off as jokes is calling Basil or Sunny ‚Äúpsychopaths‚Äù or similar labels when by clinical definition they are not. What I find concerning is if that people are using this kind of term as a insult to refer to *fictional* mentally ill people, how is that going to affect how they view *real* mentally ill people? I think it reveals a lot about how they may see people with less ‚Äúpretty‚Äù manifestations of their disorder (no disorder is pretty, but for years mental illness has been categorized into ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù ex. psychosis or personality disorders have more stigma than depression or anxiety).\n\nI also think it‚Äôs weird how people call a 12 year old a ‚Äúfreak‚Äù or ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù if they know how to tie a noose when the unfortunate reality is that many kids aged 10-12 have been suicide victims or had suicidal thoughts at that age.. the fact that people are surprised at something like that really shows ignorance when it comes to that topic, I think. \n\nThere are more examples I can think of I‚Äôm sure, but they aren‚Äôt coming to the top of my head right now. How people view the mentally ill in fiction will affect how they view mentally ill people in reality, so I think that‚Äôs why I care enough to write about it? \n\nLike I said, I don‚Äôt know if anyone else feels the same way, so maybe it‚Äôs just me. But I‚Äôd be really curious to hear others‚Äô thoughts.",

Portrayal of mental illness in media is‚Ä¶ very complicated, to say the least. \n\nAt certain points I did find myself wishing things went a little differently in the game itself. For one thing, I really wished that Basil got more screentime in the game, and that we got a little more insight into Basil‚Äôs mind re: the events that had transpired. I felt like the player was left to infer a lot of things about Basil‚Äôs experiences over the past four years, as well as Basil‚Äôs childhood and what he might have gone through back then. I think we as players might have been led to view Basil in a more sympathetic light had he been given a little more screentime.\n\nI also completely agree with your point re: psychotic disorders and how they tend to be heavily stigmatized in society (while depression and anxiety feel like they‚Äôve become more normalized nowadays).\n\nFeel free to reach out if you‚Äôd like to discuss this some more!",

Moving on to my actual point, I think he's my least forgivable because he never takes any steps to atone for his actions or do anything to improve the situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's compare to RW Aubrey and the actions we see her do and hear about in game. During the first two days we see Aubrey and co. bullying Basil in the park, going so far as to get physical. Then on the next day, push him into the lake on accident. During the lake scene we see her seem to regret it a bit, but she's still in denial of her actions. This leads to the final day, where we see her staying inside her house because of the previous day. The rest of the gang goes into her house, Kel and Aubrey start arguing, and Hero gets through to Aubrey and gets her to come to terms with what she's done. This is where it gets important, Aubrey then apologizes for her actions and tries to make up for them as best she can. Whether you feel it is too rushed or not is mostly irrelevant to my point, the point is that she makes an effort to seek forgiveness and and atone for her actions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor another example we can look at Kel and Hero. The main thing for Kel would be being too harsh on Aubrey I suppose. He's very quick to judge and fight her, whether justified or not. The worst case being in the church where he really pushed too far in the wrong place at the wrong time. After the group reconciles on the third day, he apologizes multiple times for assuming she was in the wrong and not being there for her. He feels he did something wrong and actively seeks forgiveness. Hero's main example would be when he blew up at Kel when he tried to snap him out of his depression. After his emotional outburst when he started to think again, he realized what he did was wrong and apologized to Kel, going so far as to start acting a bit more like how he used to and not locking himself up as much. Again, he actively tried to improve because of his behavior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's talk about Sunny now. This is basically the whole point of the game. The entire game is just about Sunny learning to forgive himself and to start to atone for his actions and let his friend group heal long term. It obviously all comes to a head in the climax and ending where he remembers the truth and finally confesses to them all, despite the fact that what he did was awful and they might not forgive him. It shows he's finally coming to terms with what he's done and by telling everyone wants to give them and him a chance to move on. He made the effort to save himself and Basil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow then, let's finally take a good look at Basil himself. Pretty much every time we see him in the real world, he is just a mess of anxiety and often enough getting bullied, which does make you feel bad for him, at least it makes me feel bad for him. What he did bad was obviously his actions during Mari's death. I'm operating under the assumption that, as I think is implied, it was Basil's idea to frame Mari's death as a suicide. His actions there are awful and I don't think him doing it to help Sunny makes it any better. Here's the thing, regardless of his mental health and dependency on Sunny, he chose to do this and to a lesser extent he chose to take the blame for the photo album being ruined. He chose to do because he didn't want Sunny to take the blame. This does make people what to feel bad for him because he only did it to protect Sunny, or at least what he thought would protect him. But the thing is, Sunny never asked for it. It was a decision on his part, likely fueled by his unhealthy reliance on Sunny due to his abandonment issues. This doesn't make any of the bullying that happened to him right and he doesn't deserve to suffer for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is, however, not the question at hand. The question is whether he deserves to be forgiven, and based on his actions, I don't think he does. He never makes any effort to improve the situation, seek forgiveness for what he did, or atone for his actions. His mental health struggles can explain why he acts this way, but they can't excuse it. Now, you don't get forgiven because you do or don't deserve it obviously. And in the secret ending we see that at the very minimum, Sunny doesn't blame Basil for his actions and does forgive him for his part. We don't know how the rest of the gang ultimately react to the truth, they may or may not be forgiven. I like to think that eventually they would be, but that's just me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo ultimately, the reason why Basil is my least favorite out of the main cast, as well as the least forgivable to me, is because he makes no effort to seek forgiveness or improve the situation. I still like him as a character and think he's interesting. I think this adds to his overall character and is part of WHY he's is.\n\nedit: grammar",

Like, it may just be me, but I can see him being afraid of seeing the others again but then, as time goes on, he simply starts to numb to the feeling and finds that part of him resents the others for abandoning him with his guilt for so long. I half-imagine he'd definitely resent (and potentially hate) Basil for his part. I ask because I may consider a fanfic idea with Sunny having slowly spiraled since the Truth and returning to Faraway so he can kill Basil in  a murder-suicide and finally alleviate the root of his trauma with the others finding out and trying to stop Sunny from self-destructing in a way that is far more open than Basil did. Like, the idea of Sunny returning to Faraway to kill Basil and being stopped may lead to the fear that, if he leaves Faraway, the rest of his friends will never see him again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust me throwing an idea around, I guess.",

(before i get downvoted into oblivion i know aubrey isnt a saint and also did bad stuff) \n\nAlso people saying \"they were only 12!\" is insane. 12 is NOT that young. I was 12 only 2 years ago and I can guarantee the first thing on my mind would not be to stage a suicide. Kids that age are mature enough to know the value of things (like the violin) and respect the time and effort put into practice (at least if they were raised right). If they were 8-10, then that'd be a different story, but they were old enough to know better.\n\nThe only one I could see them possibly forgiving (after a while) is Basil. He did some horrible stuff, but Sunny's done worse and him taking the blame for the album might make Aubrey sympathize with him a little more. Tho realistically i dont think anybody would forgive them (even i dont lmfao).",

    "selftext": "So I was playing Omori a few months ago, and my fav was instantly Basil, so I was excited to see where he'd go, but OOPS HE DISEAPPEARED, AND I GOT SO CONFUSED AND SAD, i mean i still had mari, my second fav, but i wanted basil. So i spent through headspace looking through him, thinking i'd find him cos he was like the thing i actually wanted to see. Then I wake up to sunny da clown, coming outside and hanging with kel, that was cool, and I see Basil, and I'm already happy, I see aubrey and I'm like \"wow this girl's kinda a bitch, I don't like her\", when Basil and sunny hung out, I then got to the bathroom scene, and then I saw sunny run away and was like \"BOI WHAT IS WRONG WITH U, WHY U DO DIS\", it felt so irritating to see basil constantly being treated like shit by everybody. so then i went through more headspace looking for the other basil, and couldnt find him, i was getting upset, and then i woke up, i then hang with kel and see aubrey being a bitch again, then she attempted murder on basil and i was so furious, like you were already a bitch for those years and now u almost murder him, thank god hero because i would have uninstalled atp if it werent for him. Anyway fuck you aubrey im glad you dont follow them. Anyway sunny plays some piano and hero comes in, its actually kinda nice because they have this moment of peace, but uhhh yea. Then headspace follows and welp... not what i wanted to happen, so i go through MOOOORE HEADSPACE, AND MOOOOOOORRREEEEEEE OF THIS DOGSHIT. anyway somewhere in the mix of this theres like, blackspace and basil, and im glad we get this cos like yk this game does not like basil so like im glad we got this, anyway he gets beaten the shit out of cos Omori's a hater. Soooooo what now? sunny wakes up to stuff, and we do kel and hero things, they even talk to aubrey, normally id love this scene and its a nice development thing for aubrey, but theres one problem. **BASIL ISNT EVEN FUCKIN THERE, WHAT IS THIS? HE WAS THE MAIN VICTIM OF THIS PROBLEM, AND ALSO SUNNY'S CLOSEST FRIEND**, AND HE DOESNT EVEN GET TO BE THERE WHEN AUBREY REDEEMS HERSELF, IM ACTUALLY FUCKING ENRAGED, YEA I KNOW WE GET KEL AND HERO WHO ARE COOL AND IM SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT THEM, BUT I WAS HOPING I COULD SEE BASIL (I DIDNT). PLUS HE DIDNT EVEN BLACK OUT THE PHOTOS SO WTF SUNNY. SO THE ENTIRETY OF THIS FARAWAY HANGOUT THINGS WERE DONE \\*\\*WITHOUT\\*\\* BASIL, AGAIN THATS ACTUALLY INFURIATING. I WAS MAD SO I JUST SKIPPED THEM (except the swing one with aubrey and the game one with kel). SO THEN WE HAD ALL THIS TALK, AND THEN A SLEEPOVER. I wont even bring up the neutral ending cos that shits a disgrace my eyes, so lets just talk about the true ending, sunny and basil fight, SUNNY IS LITERALLY ABOUT TO PULL THIS SHIT AGAIN (FUCK U BITCH) and luckily we get into a fight, which im glad, because IVE BEEN WAITING FOR BASIL, and ALL WE GOT WAS A FUCKIN FIGHT, SUNNY'S EYE GOT RIPPED OUT, but like after seeing all that was happening there? i just smiled. anyway we cut to some dream world scary stuff, explaining what happened, we also find out what sunny did to mari, and I WAS EVEN MORE UPSET, MARI WAS MY SECOND FAVORITE, oh yea we also got me some flashbacks and yay i love mari and basil, anyway back to the stuff, we then see sunny in the hospital, he finds basil and then the truth is told, and the end. WE DIDNT EVEN GET A CONCLUSION AND I KNOW THATS THE POINT BUT **STILL.** I just hate how this character gets treated",

OMOCAT said that, if Basil had his own headspace, he wouldn't be able to escape, which is just, depressing lol. Either way, it'd be super cool to explore that topic a bit more.",

Also people typically d!e with their eyes and mouth open. It's highly considered that the parents knew since there's a scebe with Sunny's dad saying \"you are not my son\" or something along those lines. Omori is trying to protect Sunny from this truth, this was vaguely explained but there in the game nonetheless. And you're correct in thinking that it was never about Basil. Dw Basil was more something in Sunny's mind who reminded him of the truth and I think Basil disappeared only because Omori didn't want Sunny to know the truth. This is further proven by how the hotel in one of the finial sections of the game is titled \"The Last Resort\" (aka the last resort to hiding the truth was to get rid of the rest of Sunny's friends and give them jobs and stuff or at least that's how I saw it) also it is said in the game that the \"dreamer\" (Sunny) has gone down this path multiple times before (by which I'm assuming this series in dreams in which Basil goes missing and Omori and friends search for him but find the truth instead) which also helps prove it wasn't about Basil. Lastly there was some cut official art of Hero, Kel and Aubrey's reactions in which all of them look disturbed/disgusted so they probably didn't forgive Sunny (or at least not right away).

I think he might be masking his pain (similar to Sayori in DDLC if anyone has played that game). Same thing goes to Hero, I don't think he ever moved on from Mari. While he isn't so depressed that he is stuck in bed all the time, I definitely don't think that he is as strong as he appears. This can be supported by the fact that he chose to move away for college. While many kid's do move away, it's also common to live with your parents if you're close. Also based on the little details of the game I'm going to assume the game took place around the early 2000s-2010s meaning depending on the time rent might have been really high which means it's more unlikely to want to move far away. Hero might have wanted an escape from his life. And the fact that Hero had never visted Mari helps with this theory. I also head canon that after the death of Basil's grandma, Polly would still stick around. This one is purely a head canon since I have no evidence for it. It is stated in the game that Polly is taking care of his grandma, not Basil himself, however it is evident that Polly cares for Basil. I'd like to believe that she would stick around to make sure he is okay after the death of his grandma. I could go on and on about different theories and head canons for this game. It's been all I can think about for the past 3 years of my life ![img](emote|t5_31hpy|28941) I think all of these are widely accepted in the community (especially the one about Kel) but they're my top 3 and I feel like going into detail about my weirder theories would be too random abd confusing lol ![img](emote|t5_31hpy|2467)",

        "body": "1. Dead people's eyes usually open a while after they die because of their muscles relaxing, so the eye doesn't mean that she survived. It might've also just been Sunny's imagination. She landed onto a broken violin with her neck/head, even if she didn't immediately die from that she would've probably died just a few minutes later. The sheet music was also full of blood and the violin had hair strands in it, so it's not like she just avoided falling onto it. One of the rooms you visit when searching for the truth photos says ''This person is breathing steadily'' and then later changes to ''This person is not breathing'', so I assume that means she either died in that bed or that that was when Sunny and Basil realized she was actually dead. Either way she was probably dead before they even took her outside.\n2. This point is purposely left ambiguous. Personally, I think they knew, but it's not confirmed either way. There's a scene after going into one of the holes left behind by the hangman keys where a man is chopping down a tree with a nose, if you interact with him he says \"Stay away, you are not my son'', and in another black space room there's a pond that gives some random dialogue lines when interacting with it, one of those lines is ''You see a man shutting his car door and driving away'', which to me implies that his dad abandoned Sunny and his mom for what he did to Mari. Sunny's mom also has some lines saying ''My only daughter... is gone, and you... you are my only son. I can't... lose you as well.'' which also implies she knows more and is trying to protect Sunny from the police to avoid losing the only child she has left.\n3. This is mostly canon.\n4. Also canon, kind of. Omori needed some kind of quest to keep Sunny interested in headspace, and Basil just reminded him of the truth, so he just hit two birds with one stone and got rid of Basil while also using him to keep Sunny occupied.",

(The Beast):\nIn this universe, Sunny suddenly gains a rare condition called Emotional-Chromatic Shift Disorder, causing him to transform into a gigantic, grey-skinned, muscular version of himself whenever he's enraged or scared and his first transformation happened during the argument between him and Mari at the stairs but when he fully transforms he sees his now enlarged grey hands and panics, backing into the wall and Mari comforts him until he transforms back into his normal form, where he sleeps and Mari sees that Basil had seen everything and the next day, which is Mari and Sunny's recital, Sunny and Mari's parents manage to repair the violin but when they arrive at the stairs of the stage, Sunny has a panic attack and begins to transform but Mari comforts him, causing him to rapidly transform into his grey-skinned and normal form as if The Beast is trying to escape until Sunny has a near-fatal seizure due to his brain being unable to handle switching between his enraged primal state and his normal, calm state and the recital is cancelled as Sunny is rushed to hospital for his seizure and it is there that he gets the diagnosis of Emotional-Chromatic Shift Disorder (ECSD) and over the course of many rampages and years, Mari gradually becomes overprotective and overbearing, isolating him from everything because she's terrified of what her brother is capable of when he's angry and Omori in this universe is an idolised version of Sunny where never had ECSD.\n(TL:DR; It's basically what would happen if Sunny suddenly gained the powers of The Incredible Hulk.)\n\nAnd that's it. Hope you like them, Omori community and which ones are your favourite, let me know in the comments.",

This is just another \"Hero tagged you\" meme honestly.\n\nLike I get she'd be angry or upset but putting him in a coma?? Just... no. No. It's 100% unlikely she'd EVER do that, it's OOC for her and Sunny wouldn't even have any reason to be knocked out like that. It makes the situation worse and even more worse as it gets on, she has absolutely no reason to knock him out too due to the whole swing sequence, she knows how fragile he is and that he's pale and thin. He's even smaller than her and to her that'd probably seem like bullying which she obviously doesn't like doing. Anyways onto the others.\n\nSunny's mom likely knows about the truth, I mean idk exactly why she wanted to move out in OMORI but it's likely to do with her completely wanting to get rid of the truth and move away from Sunny's friends, Basil doesn't need to forgive Sunny cause he was in on the accident so it'd be a bit OOC too. Hero I can agree on will never forgive him, but he'd be able to tolerate him, Hero knows what it's like to be depressed or guilt ridden, him doing the \"Hero tagged you\" aswell would make no sense and him lashing out of Sunny would probably not happen, best case scenario? He'd just leave and stay cooped up at home for a couple weeks or so. Kel will most likely take a bit to heal but would come across and realize it was an accident.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTruthfully it's left ambiguous of what WOULD/WILL happen in the ending but 50/50 I don't agree on these theories, despite that they are theories, I just don't really agree all too well. Sunny is a sweet and shy kid, them lashing out and hurting him wouldn't make them look any better, they'd even escalate things for our own needs. That's not like that, they're all childhood friends. Like I said them hurting Sunny in any way isn't what they would do, they would just go their separate ways and try to recover.",

What I mean is fundamentally the game is about Sunny and his trauma over his sister's death, however with the reveal of the truth, does the trauma of the group that was explored earlier become undermined? The game did use the real world sections to explore how the group dealt with Mari's death and apparent suicide, but with the introduction of the truth plot element, it could be argued that their their relevance and feelings in the grander story is reduced, if not pushed to full irrelevance. The game only explores their feelings to the false narrative, and they are never privy to the truth until the end, where the game doesn't show their reactions, making it come across as they are unimportant in the end. There's also the fact that Sunny uses their positive words and encouragement to push through in the final fight, but these words of encouragement came from before their knowledge of the truth, making Sunny using these words as kind of manipulative on his part. Some people even go as far as saying the game reduces Kel, Hero, and Aubery to mere props to be used as encouragement for Sunny and nothing more. I don't nesscarily agree, but what do you guys think?",

As soon as Sunny tells the truth, the story is over.\n\nSorry if I‚Äôve worded this poorly, but as I see it ultimately the story is about Sunny coming to terms with the truth and working up the courage to confront it.

They play their part, their friendship is ultimately invaluable to both our main character in Sunny, but the games message as well. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre just thrown in there to be used, and even with the red herring narrative, we get to at least participate meaningfully in their lives and try to help and understand them. It‚Äôs just that, quite frankly, their situations are more readily understandable and less dire than that of Sunny‚Äôs. Which is how it should be, the narrative should be focused on and in support of the most interesting idea, and that is within Sunny.",
