# OMORI Community Digital Ethnography
Dataset and Interactive Reader

This repository contains:
- omori_posts.json ‚Äî a cleaned, JSON dataset of r/OMORI posts and first‚Äëlevel comments filtered by a mental‚Äëhealth keyword gate.
- index.html ‚Äî an interactive, OMORI‚Äëthemed reader that renders the dataset for close reading.
- dataextraction.py ‚Äî a PRAW-based script to (re)create the dataset from Reddit‚Äôs API.
- a series of media and UI assets (soundtrack mp3, font ttf, images/gifs). Optional for core use.

The project accompanies the article ‚ÄúHarnessing Computational Social Science: A Framework for Digital Ethnography of Online Communities‚Äù (Di Leo, 2025), which formalizes an auditable loop between automated discovery and interpretive reading.

## Quick start

- View the interactive reader
  - Recommended: serve files locally to avoid browser restrictions on fetch/file URLs.
  - From the repository root:
    - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
    - Node: `npx http-server .`
  - Open http://localhost:8000/ and click index.html (or go directly to http://localhost:8000/index.html).
  - The reader loads omori_posts.json from the same folder by default.
  - Alternatively, simply visit [https://nadiadileo.github.io/Omori-Prototype/](https://nadiadileo.github.io/Omori-Prototype/) to access the publicly released version of the reader, hosted on Github Pages.

- Use a different dataset file
  - Place your JSON file alongside index.html and rename it to omori_posts.json, or
  - Edit index.html to point the fetch(...) call at your file‚Äôs name.

## What‚Äôs in the dataset?

Top‚Äëlevel structure: an array of post objects. Each post contains metadata, full selftext, and an array of first‚Äëlevel comments (no deeper nesting).

Minimal example (truncated):
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1jorbr8",
    "title": "There is nothing we can do..",
    "author": "user_7dd0fea51c57",
    "created_utc": 1743499132.0,
    "created_date": "2025-04-01 11:18:52",
    "score": 187,
    "upvote_ratio": 0.94,
    "num_comments": 26,
    "url": "https://i.redd.it/4qnb8rlyx6se1.png",
    "selftext": "Very Sad day for the Sunburn Shippers in this subreddit üòû",
    "is_self": false,
    "is_video": false,
    "link_flair_text": "Meme",
    "over_18": false,
    "spoiler": false,
    "comments": [
      {
        "id": "mktuqx4",
        "author": "user_7539a7047220",
        "body": "They are just holding hands, like brest friends would!\n\nAlso where is the Silkpost flair?",
        "created_utc": 1743499276.0,
        "created_date": "2025-04-01 11:21:16",
        "score": 65,
        "is_submitter": false,
        "topics": ["character_relationships", "meta"]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
 
### Post fields

- id: Reddit base36 string (post id).
- title: post title.
- author: hashed token.
- created_utc: Unix epoch (float, seconds).
- created_date: local timestamp string, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
- score: integer score at capture time.
- upvote_ratio: 0‚Äì1 float.
- num_comments: number of comments at capture time.
- url: link target (image, external URL, or post URL).
- selftext: Markdown/plaintext body (empty for link posts).
- is_self: boolean (text/self post).
- is_video: boolean (if known).
- link_flair_text: flair at capture time (may be null).
- over_18: boolean (NSFW flag).
- spoiler: boolean.
- topics: array of string tags assigned during qualitative coding.
- comments: array of first‚Äëlevel comment objects (see below).

Note: Some distributions may omit or redact direct permalinks to preserve contextual integrity. If present, permalink is a Reddit path to the post.

### Comment fields

- id: comment id (base36).
- author: hashed token.
- body: comment text.
- created_utc, created_date: as above.
- score: integer score at capture time.
- is_submitter: boolean (comment author is also the post author).
- topics (optional): array of string tags assigned during qualitative coding.

### Topic tags (optional annotations)

Topics are drawn from a controlled vocabulary used in the study:

- meta, memes, storyline_discussion, character_relationships, ending_discussion
- therapy_and_coping_strategies, asking_for_mental_health_advice
- depression, sadness, loneliness, trauma_and_ptsd, guilt
- suicide_and_self_harm, venting, frustration, mutual_support
- gameplay_advice, opinions_about_the_games_emotional_intensity
- fan_creations_and_cosplays, positive_emotions, deleted_or_removed, links_or_images

## How the interactive reader works (index.html)

- Data loading
    - On load, the interface fetches omori_posts.json (same directory).
    - Posts are assigned stable, session‚Äëlocal ordinal indices (post_index = 0..N-1).
    - First‚Äëlevel comments are shown in the order provided (typically chronological).

- Layout and choreography
    - Post selector: a list/panel of post titles with indices; choose any to open.
    - Central scene: the selected post renders in a central ‚Äúbubble,‚Äù paginated for long texts.
    - Peripheral replies: up to six comment ‚Äúslots‚Äù surround the post; comments rotate in order across turns.
    - Turn‚Äëtaking: click anywhere (or use the Next control) to advance typing/pagination and cycle replies. This pacing supports close reading by slowing skimming.

- Accessibility and controls
    - High‚Äëcontrast theme; alt text for controls.
    - Audio toggle: background music can be turned on/off. It is optional for use.
    - Optional text‚Äëto‚Äëspeech toggle to read the visible page aloud (if supported by the browser).
    - Note: Current build prioritizes desktop; small screens may require zooming. Keyboard navigation may be limited.

- Scope
    - Only first‚Äëlevel comments are shown (no deep threaded nesting).
    - The reader is data‚Äëdriven: swap in any file named omori_posts.json with the same schema to reuse the interface.

## Recreate/extend the dataset (dataextraction.py)

The included script collects r/OMORI posts via Reddit‚Äôs API using PRAW and applies a keyword gate to titles/selftexts.

- Requirements
    - Python 3.9+ recommended
    - `pip install praw`
    - A Reddit app (script or installed app) with client id/secret and a descriptive user agent
    - Compliance with Reddit‚Äôs API Terms of Use

- Configure credentials
    - For security, prefer environment variables over hard‚Äëcoding secrets:
        - REDDIT_CLIENT_ID
        - REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET
        - REDDIT_USER_AGENT
        - REDDIT_USERNAME (if using script auth)
        - REDDIT_PASSWORD (if using script auth)
    - The provided script includes placeholders; update safely before running.

- Run
    - `python dataextraction.py`
    - Output: omori_posts.json (default) or a filename you pass into `scrape_omori_subreddit(output_filename)`

- What the script does
    - Queries multiple listing types: hot, new, top(all), rising, controversial(all).
    - Deduplicates by post id across listings.
    - Keyword gate: configurable via `KEYWORDS` at the top of the file.
    - For matched posts, collects post metadata and all first‚Äëlevel comments.
    - Periodic JSON saves; light sleep to respect rate limits.

- Important notes
    - Ethics: Review the article‚Äôs guidance and AoIR/IRB norms for sensitive content. Pseudonymize authors before public release; consider redacting links/permalinks for contextual integrity.
    - Reproducibility: API results are time‚Äëvarying; scores and comment counts reflect capture time.

## Repository structure

- index.html ‚Äî interactive reader (loads omori_posts.json by default).
- omori_posts.json ‚Äî dataset (array of posts with nested first‚Äëlevel comments).
- dataextraction.py ‚Äî Reddit API pipeline (PRAW).

You can remove or replace assets without affecting basic functionality; the reader will still render text.
